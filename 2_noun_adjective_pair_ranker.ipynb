Being an apple fan, I love these! They are so easy to connect! Once I connected them to my iPhone, they were seamlessly connected to my other apple devices. All I have to do is select them in the list from the device you need them to connect and you are good to go. Another good thing is turning them on/off is easy, just remove them from the charging case and they turn on and put them back to turn them off, its simple. And like most of the earphones out there, they connect to the last device you used them with, but its easy to switch device. You have the flexibility to just use one piece, if you like and sometimes it does come handy. Another function I like is the automatic ear detection, just remove a piece from you ear and playback will pause and resume once you put it back, this does help when someone drops by for a conversation and you don't need to actually pickup your phone to pause the playback. The battery life is definitely impressive, I need to charge the case every 2 days. And it's easy to carry everywhere, it being so small. Now the sound quality is crisp and connection is smooth, I found that the 2nd gen AirPods are actually better and improved on 1st gen, but its not worth to upgrade, but if you are planning to get your first one, I would definitely say go for the 2nd gen AirPods, I got a pretty sweet deal on amazon and am very happy with my purchase.</td>\n","      <td>pair of earphones, battery life, sound quality, connectino, deal</td>\n","      <td>best, definitely impressive, crisp, smooth, pretty sweet</td>\n","      <td>positive</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RM7B0QA6K2S1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B07PXGQC1Q</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>Okay, so I bought these after my third pair of cheaper wireless headphones broke. I was getting tired of ones that attached and had the cord that went around my neck. Hence, I decided to search the internet for the best headphones that would work for listening to music/audio books while working out or doing things around the house. I finally decided to try out the AirPods since they had such great reviews, and because they were on sale. When I received the AirPods, I was surprised at how well they actually fit in my ears. I had worried about them falling out, and though they have fallen out a few times due to my children rough housing and landing on my head, they have worked great for walking around the house and exercising. The sound quality is really amazing, and I am pleasantly surprised at how quickly they charge. I will update this once I've had them longer than a few weeks, but I am extremely impressed with them so far. I was extremely skeptical at first, but I'm very glad I decided to get them!</td>\n","      <td>headphones, reviews, sound quality</td>\n","      <td>best, great, really amazing</td>\n","      <td>positive</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                                                                                                         Link  ...

Being an apple fan, I love these! They are so easy to connect! Once I connected them to my iPhone, they were seamlessly connected to my other apple devices. All I have to do is select them in the list from the device you need them to connect and you are good to go. Another good thing is turning them on/off is easy, just remove them from the charging case and they turn on and put them back to turn them off, its simple. And like most of the earphones out there, they connect to the last device you used them with, but its easy to switch device. You have the flexibility to just use one piece, if you like and sometimes it does come handy. Another function I like is the automatic ear detection, just remove a piece from you ear and playback will pause and resume once you put it back, this does help when someone drops by for a conversation and you don't need to actually pickup your phone to pause the playback. The battery life is definitely impressive, I need to charge the case every 2 days. And it's easy to carry everywhere, it being so small. Now the sound quality is crisp and connection is smooth, I found that the 2nd gen AirPods are actually better and improved on 1st gen, but its not worth to upgrade, but if you are planning to get your first one, I would definitely say go for the 2nd gen AirPods, I got a pretty sweet deal on amazon and am very happy with my purchase.</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","      <td>The battery life is definitely impressive</td>\n","      <td>The battery life is definitely impressive, I need to charge the case every 2 days.</td>\n","      <td>[(battery, life), impressive]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>27</th>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","      <td>These are the best pair of wireless earphones I ever came across, apple has definitely done it again.

Being an apple fan, I love these! They are so easy to connect! Once I connected them to my iPhone, they were seamlessly connected to my other apple devices. All I have to do is select them in the list from the device you need them to connect and you are good to go. Another good thing is turning them on/off is easy, just remove them from the charging case and they turn on and put them back to turn them off, its simple. And like most of the earphones out there, they connect to the last device you used them with, but its easy to switch device. You have the flexibility to just use one piece, if you like and sometimes it does come handy. Another function I like is the automatic ear detection, just remove a piece from you ear and playback will pause and resume once you put it back, this does help when someone drops by for a conversation and you don't need to actually pickup your phone to pause the playback. The battery life is definitely impressive, I need to charge the case every 2 days. And it's easy to carry everywhere, it being so small.
