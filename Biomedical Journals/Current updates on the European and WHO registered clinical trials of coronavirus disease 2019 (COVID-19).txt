Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major public health concern currently. To date, there are no approved antiviral drugs or vaccines against this transmissible disease. This report sheds light on available information for a better understanding of clinical trials and pharmacotherapy related to COVID-19. MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus databases, Web of Science, WHO, and EU clinical trial sites were used to perform comparative analysis. Information was collected on the use of therapeutic agents for human therapy in patients with COVID-19 up to May 2020. We have extracted data from 60 clinical trials. Amongst these trials, 34 were from the European Union database of clinical trials and 26 from the National Institute of Health. The data selection procedure includes active, completed, and recruitment in progress status. Most of the clinical trials are ongoing and hence, there is a lack of precise results for the treatment.There is a lack of high-quality clinical evidence. The protocol to be developed requires large randomized clinical trials with a combination of available drugs and prospective therapies. We propose the usage of a large number of cases and different statistical analyses to conduct systematic clinical trials. This could provide comprehensive information about the clinical trial and potential therapeutic progress.

COVID-19 is a pneumonia-like disease, which is caused by a novel coronavirus [1]. Coronavirus belongs to Orthocoronavirinae subfamily of the Coronaviridae family within the order Nidovirales. COVID-19 is the defining global health crisis that has spread over 205 countries including USA, Italy, Russia, Spain, Japan, Korea, Iran, and Germany [2,3]. By the end of December 2019, a serious pneumonia like cluster of cases with unknown source expanded globally from Wuhan, China [4]. Various reports suggest that the novel coronavirus is 96.2% identical to a bat CoV RaTG13 [5,6]. Evolutionary analysis of virus genome has suspected bat as a natural host of the virus origin that could have been transmitted from an unknown intermediate host to the humans [7]. The infection poses a significant risk to patients with COVID-19 due to the high frequency of pneumonia, fever, and dry cough. Additionally, patients suffer from the potential damage of vital organs, especially the lungs, heart, liver, and kidneys [[8], [9], [10]]. As per the latest reports from China, the mortality rate of COVID-19 disease is approximately 3–4% [11]. The latest data obtained on 30 June 2020 describes that COVID-19 has infected more than Ten million people worldwide. Amongst these cases, 5.6 million have been successfully treated and 5,08,422 has died. The number of infected people is increasing every day by one thousand worldwide.

Recently, severity model based analysis has showed that the fatality ratio for China is 0·66%, on the Diamond Princess ship is 2.3%, and the large meta-analysis of 36 European countries showed the case-fatality rate of COVID-19 range of 4%–4.5% with an increasing profile with age [[12], [13], [14]]. Furthermore, in current scenario, India is ranked as the fourth highest country with positive cases and a case-fatality rate of 1.9–3.6% [15]. In the current situation, a second wave of coronavirus has hit the major cities of European countries including Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, which is the centre for pandemic. Till date, more than 1.3 million positive cases have been identified in Brazil [16]. In Russia, more than 687,862 cases and 10,296 deaths due to COVID-19 infection has been reported [17].

In order to treat COVID-19, the only available treatment currently available is the retroviral therapy. Further, it was proven that convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT) is useful against COVID-19 [18,19]. At this crucial moment, in-depth research is essential to treat and prevent the disease. Several researchers have promptly carried out clinical research aimed towards the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19 [20]. However, globally there is limited information available to analyze and summarize the registered clinical trials. The purpose of this review is to summaries existing COVID-19 clinical trial data that would aid in selecting the most appropriate COVID-19 treatment.

Search Strategy And Selection Criteria
Using various keywords related to COVID-19 including comorbidities, clinical characteristics, epidemiological, immunotherapy, vaccine, and SARS CoV-2 clinical trial data were obtained from different electronic databases. Some of these databases were European union clinical trials database, Clinical Trial Registry, Clinicatrial.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and the Wanfang Database. Pubmed, the National Library of Medicine (NLM), and EMBASE database were also used to identify ongoing trials.

Literature Inclusion And Exclusion Criteria
All investigators have selected only the most appropriate and suitable studies. Inclusion criteria encompasses the following: (1) studies of COVID-19 patients’ clinical trials, (2) detailed protocol of clinical trials, (3) data mining, (4) the original design type (Interventional or observational), (5) reports that involved the treatment of COVID-19. The exclusion criteria includes the following: (1) studies having duplicate data and (2) vague theoretical research and unregistered clinical trials.

Quality Assessment
Quality of clinical data and extracted data from the literature were assessed by rigorous information cross-check. Discrepancy between the investigators was resolved and the final decisions were decided without any conflicts. Relevant data was summarized in a narrative manner and the treatment strategy was grouped. Each table was categorized according to the drug usage. Results were classified based on the type of study, country, dose, duration of administration, an indication of medication, and the number of patients included in the study.

Results
Trial search outcomes
34 clinical trials from the European Union clinical trial database and 26 clinical trials from the National Institute of Health (NIH) clinical trial database were retrieved and presented in the flow chart [Fig. 1]. A total of 60 clinical trials of COVID-19 were classified as either active, completed, or recruiting. 8 patients used hydroxyquinone alone or in combination with other drugs, 6 used remdesivir, 5 used Tocilizumab, Lopinavir/ritonavir either single or combined, 4 used Interferon alpha and beta, and 4 patients used Plaquenil. All other remaining cases used different types of molecules or interventions [Table 1 and Table 2]. Above all, most of the trials have cleared the ethical approval. Some of the case studies are still in the recruitment phase, whereas 20 trials have begun recruiting patients. Amongst them, only 4 trials are in active phase and in the next few days, patient recruitment will begin. 2 clinical trials are still incomplete.

The first randomized controlled clinical pathways were sponsored by Dongzhimen Hospital of the Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations). Those drugs were registered as “Chinese Severe Pneumonia Medicine with Severe Coronavirus Pneumonia” on 3 January 2020. In this review, we have included 60 trials in terms of clinical trial phases. Amongst them, 43 trials are in the preliminary experimental phase, 7 are in the middle phase, 8 are in phase 3 and extended for validation. 1 trial is completed with Ganovo+ritonavir ± Interferon nebulization drugs and ready for sale as the same diagnostic kit (Quest Diagnostics, Bill and Melinda).

Intervention and evaluation
The leading intervention strategy of registered clinical trials consists of traditional Chinese medicine, western medicine, and conventional integrated treatment. Especially, the outcome of therapy includes treatment time, patient immunity, frequency of use of ventilation, mortality, number of complications, and virological detection indicators. Current duration of the medication is more than 10 days. Medicinal approaches include oral, injection, and inhalation. The control subject was treated regularly with a placebo. At present, 24 western medicinal treatments are registered in clinical trials. On the other hand, single or combination of biological agents such as hydroxychloroquine, camostat mesilate, sargramostim, colchicine, tocilizumab, remdesivir, Itraconazole, IFX-1, Imatinib mesilate, Interferon beta-1a (IFN-β1a), Sarilumab, Budesonide, and Nitric Oxide 0.5%/Nitrogen 99.5% Gas for Inhalation, Recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, Plaquenil, lopinavir/ritonavir, RoActemra, Chloroquine phosphate, Hydrocortisone, Levofloxacin, Emapalumab, Anakinra, Sarilumab, Danoprevir+ritonavir ± Interferon, Emtricitabine/tenofovir are listed as intervention methods.

Two clinical trials include biological agents product mRNA, blood stem cells, cord blood mononuclear cells, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), recombinant cytokine gene-derived vector, and immunoglobulin (IgM, IgG).

Discussion
Since the impact of COVID-19 is extremely severe, the development of an effective treatment strategy against the infection is very critical and concerning throughout the world. Although the molecular diagnosis, treatment, and international public health has improved after experiencing the 2003 SARS (CoV-I) epidemic, due to the new mutant form of the COVID virus, it is difficult to diagnose and treat the infection. Moreover, there is no proven or recognized licensed therapy against COVID-19. This sudden event has caused a high mortality rate in China and other countries around the world, mainly the European regions. The current situation leads us to carry out a systematic review to summarize the on-going clinical trials and possible therapeutic options against COVID-19 [1,11,21]. Intensive clinical trials are being conducted by many researchers to eradicate this disease.

Most of the reports demonstrate the intervention of western medicine and a combination of traditional medicine to treat COVID-19 infection. Most of the studies are still in the preliminary experimental phase of the clinical trail. There are 43 extended (Phase 1) trial studies that show the utilization of drugs (Hydroxychloroquine, Camostat mesilate, Sargramostim, Colchicine, Tocilizumab, Remdesivir, Itraconazole, IFX-1, Imatinib mesilate, Interferon beta-1a (IFN-β1a), Kevzara, Budesonide, Lopinavir/ritonavir, RoActemra, Chloroquine phosphate, Hydrocortisone, Levofloxacin, Emapalumab, Anakinra, Sarilumab). According to the population size used in the clinical trial, 18 interventional clinical trials were carried out, which included 4 to 4000 candidates/trials and 8 observational studies, that included around 1000 to 3000000 candidates. Most of the trials are on-going; thus, the confirmation level and the clinical significance is limited [Table 1].

The alternative strategy to fight against COVID-19 is mainly based on boosting immune responses and to prevent the disease complications. This strategy improves patient immunity by predominating self-immune damage to the cytokine storm (modulating the post-infection immune response) and symptomatic treatment [22]. Although some Chinese herbs have shown both antiviral and high immune effects, current situations prove that the antiviral effect of western drugs is superior and tolerable in comparison to the traditional ayurvedic, Unani, or homeopathic medicines [23,24]. The combination of Qingfeipaidutang and hydroxychloroquine phosphate might be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment and management of COVID-19 [25,26]. Recently, an open-label, randomized clinical trial of standard medical treatment or colchicine (1.5-mg loading dose by 0.5 mg after 60 min and maintenance doses of 0.5 mg twice daily) in 105 patients showed that event-free survival time was 20.7 days in the colchicine group and 18.6 days in the control group and a significantly improved time to clinical deterioration [27]. Another multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial in 160 patients with Shenhuang granule (50 g of Panax ginseng C. A. Mey, 40 g of Rheum palmatum L. stem, 30 g of Sargentodoxa cuneata stem, 30 g of Taraxacum mongolicum, 50 g of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata, and 6 g of Whitmania pigra Whitman) twice a day for 14 days is underway and the trail results are awaiting [28].

Still, there is a lack of high-grade substantiation evidence that demands further clinical clarification and verification. Several clinical researchers have used biological products for the treatment of COVID-19. In order to treat COVID-19 infection, Steroid-based therapy has been implemented and the result availability is limited for trials [13,29]. The most commonly used drug is chloroquine (anti-malaria) and ribavirin with a broad-spectrum antiviral combination of Remdesivir and IFN-α2b. An interventional study based in Spain was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on 1 April 2020 (ID: NCT04334928). Currently, this is the only clinical trial underway with Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil/hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19 infection. Due to minimal interaction, the combination of baricitinib and lopinavir/ritonavir/remdeviate antivirals was used to treat the infection COVID-19 during the pandemic. The combination of baricitinib and above-mentioned drugs may reduce viral replication, infectivity, and aberrant host inflammatory response [30].

Future perspective
In most trials, inclusion and exclusion criteria has eliminated children under 18 years, pregnant women, and comorbidities like liver, heart, and kidney disease. This may result in a lack of substantial clinical evidence. The quality of clinical research needs to improve drastically. Registered clinical trials must follow Observatory/Interventional Clinical Trial Guidelines. Clinical trials must not be registered without accurate drug testing. Safety guidelines for in vitro experiments during clinical trials are a major concern. Thus, The National Science Research Administration (NASR) should consider improving the health risks assessment, good research practice, and coordination of fewer promising drugs i.e.; Remdesivir. Moreover, a major limitation of the registered clinical studies is that most of them follow a traditional conservative approach without considering the timeline.

Conclusion
Due to the lack of intensive and high-quality clinical evidence, there is no final consent to the ideal therapy for COVID-19. It is difficult to obtain reliable data even with a small sample size and prolonged study periods. There is a undoubted need for protocol development that can be used for large randomized clinical trials. In order to establish such clinical trials, prospective therapies must be designed. The NASR must improve the good clinical practice in research and coordination along as well as aid in improving the efficacy and quality of the study that could deal with current health emergencies. Besides, during clinical trials, the implementation of a variety of study designs with a large number of cases and different statistical analyses is crucial. Further; we must recognize the ancient history report of previous infectious diseases in order to implement novel conceptual health-related policies.
