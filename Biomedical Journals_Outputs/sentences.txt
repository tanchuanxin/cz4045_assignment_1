that continuously reappear, thus causing many epidemics/outbreaks.': 18, 'Viruses such as enteroviruses (EV), dengue virus (DENV), and influenza viruses (e.g.': 12, 'H1N1, H5N1, H7N9) to name a few,

re-emerging viruses are always urgent as we continuously face their strong threats for our lives.': 21, 'To examine the efficacy of developed vaccines, neutralization activity of immunized animals and even human individuals was one of the most important indicators for vaccine evaluation; however, the highly pathogenic viruses needed to be operated in a high level of biosafety containment to protect not only laboratory personnel, as well as the surrounding environment and community, which increased the accessability difficulty for in vitro viral infection experiment including neutralization assay.': 70, 'Pseudovirus system have been widely applied in the studies of highly pathogenic viruses, including SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 and high pathogenic avian influenza virus, which reduced the safety requirement and increase the accessability of neutralization assay against these viruses [9,10,14,29,30,32,36,37,40].': 37, 'We here developed two series of pseudoviruses for emerging coronavirus

of the SARS-CoV-2 and avian influenza H5Nx pseudoviruses can be blocked by the antisera raised by SARS-CoV-2 S protein and inactivated avian influenza H5Nx pseudovirus, respectively.': 34, 'The successful neutralization indicated that the assay can be applied in vaccine development of either emerging or re-emerging viruses and the assay can be operated in a more available biosafety facility.': 31, 'In addition to evaluate the neutralization activity, vaccine development needs to evaluate the antigenicity and immunogenicity for vaccine seed strain selection, especially for re-emerging viruses such as avian influenza virus H5 containing various subtypes.': 34, 'Although recent emerging SARS-CoV-2 has only one dominant strain with genetic variants, we suspected that the emerging virus might steadily evolve with “antigenic drift” like influenza virus under strong herd immunity in the near future due to the high transmission rate with millions of confirmed reported cases around the world.': 50, 'If the recent emerging SARS-CoV-2 continuously circulates among the community and becomes another ‘re-emerging virus’, SARS-CoV-2 will also face a strong positive selection pressure from herd immunity which drives the virus to exhibit diverse antigenic properties and causes antigenic property changes.': 41, 'Constant surveying of the antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus and updating the vaccine antigen for inactivated vaccine, recombinant S protein antigen for subunit vaccine, or even delivered S gene for DNA/RNA vaccine are necessary in the process of vaccine development.': 40, 'In the following of surveying antigenic property of re-emerging virus, the immunogenicity of re-emerging S protein/gene will be next examined.': 20, 'The immunogenicity

utilizing pseudovirus of re-emerging viruses.': 41, 'As we used various H5Nx concentrated pseudovirus as antigens to immunize mice, we revealed minor diversity of antigenic property and immunogenicity of each examined H5Nx pseudovirus by antigenic cartography.': 29, 'In previous studies, antigenic cartography was successfully applied using influenza, enterovirus A71, and dengue viruses to access

of pseudovirions in the process of vaccine development.': 12, 'Pseudovirus system showed convincing results for vaccine efficacy by applying pseudovirions in neutralization assay for both SARS-CoV-2 and avian influenza viruses.': 21, 'In addition, we showed the potency of pseudovirions to be applied in antigenic property analysis and immunogenicity analysis, which is especially important for antigen candidate selection.': 26, 'Most important of all, the pseudovirus system exhibited a lower biosafety risk than wild-type high risk viruses such as SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 and highly pathogenic

into macrophages.': 16, 'Macrophages, whether recruited or tissue resident, are known for their phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity.': 14, 'They can be polarized to become classically activate, “M1-like” macrophages, which are considered to be pro-inflammatory, or alternatively activated, “M2-like” macrophages, which possess anti-inflammatory properties and can initiate tissue repair [26].': 31, 'Generally, In RA tissues, M1-like macrophages overexpress MHC class II molecules, which indicate their activation and promotion of inflammation and tissue damage (Kinne et al., 2000).': 26, 'They secrete a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the joints of patients affected by RA, such as TNF, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-15, IL-18 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) (reviewed in (McInnes et al., 2016)).': 34, 'In addition, macrophages are responsible for inflammation damage through the release of matrix metalloproteinases (Blom et al., 2007).': 18, 'On the other hand, M2-like macrophages release anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-10, PGE2 and TGF-β, which initiate tissue repair and remodeling and contribute to vasculogenesis [27].': 27, 'Moreover, IL-4 and TGF-β may induce macrophages to favor matrix deposition [28].': 12, 'However, it is important to note that in the context of a complicated disease like RA, macrophages exist on a wide spectrum between the M1- and M2-like phenotypes [19,27].': 29, 'Future studies that employ single-cell RNA seq analysis should be able to accurately identify the various synovial macrophage subsets in RA patients, which may lead to novel therapeutic approaches that target specific macrophage subsets in RA.': 36, 'To summarize, the pathogenic roles of monocytes and macrophages in RA are mainly due to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and free radicals, and the release of matrix metalloproteinases that lead to joint inflammation and destruction.': 39, 'The complex roles of dendritic cells in RA\nThe involvement of dendritic cells (DCs) in tolerance and autoimmunity is complex and bidirectional.': 22, 'Indeed, DCs might promote tolerance through multiple mechanisms, including through the generation and maintenance of TReg cells, as well as through the induction of T cell unresponsiveness [29].': 28, 'Conversely, the antigen presentation capacity of DCs might promote the priming and/or the effector differentiation of self-reactive T cells.': 19, 'In inflamed RA synovial tissue, most antigen presenting cells (APCs) are fully differentiated DCs expressing high levels of class I and II MHC and T cell co-stimulatory molecules [30,31].': 29, 'Flow cytometry and histologic analyses of DC subsets have shown a trend toward a reduced number of circulating DCs in RA patients associated with a concomitant increase in the inflamed tissue [31].': 32, 'DC subsets differ considerably in localization, cytokine secretion, and immunological function.': 11, 'There are two main DC subsets involved in RA pathogenesis: conventional DCs (cDCs), also known as classical DCs, and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs).': 22, 'cDCs can be broadly subdivided into two subsets, cDC1 and cDC2, which are specialized in presenting endogenous and exogenous antigen on both MHC-I and II, to CD8 and CD4 T cells, respectively [32].': 33, 'Conversely, pDCs are found circulating in the blood and in peripheral organs and are uniquely able to rapidly produce large amounts of type I interferons upon viral infection [32].': 29, 'The accumulation of cDCs in autoimmune sites can be a consequence of the increased expression of chemokine receptors or their specific ligands in the tissue.': 25, "For example, cDCs express the CCL20 receptor, CCR6, which mediates the attraction of DC and Th17 cells to the tissues and allows mature cDCs to accumulate in the perivascular region of RA patients' synovium [33].": 35, 'Alternatively, defective migration to the draining lymph nodes from the inflamed tissue may be the cause of accumulation.': 18, 'It is believed that a local maturation process mediates the sequestration of DCs in the leukocyte aggregates in the inflamed tissue of RA patients [34].': 25, 'In addition, cell-free RA synovial fluid facilitated DC maturation from myeloid progenitors, providing direct evidence that the inflamed RA joint environment instructs DC growth [30,31].': 25, 'Mature cDCs can then polarize naïve T lymphocytes into Th1, Th2, TReg, or TH17 through the secretion of different sets of cytokines [35].': 23, 'The accumulation of danger signals in the inflamed tissue stimulates and drives the cDCs to immunogenic or tolerogenic profiles.': 19, 'The release of cytokines that prime an improper autoantigen presentation leads to dysregulated autoreactive T and B lymphocytes that contribute to the physiopathology of autoimmune disorders.': 26, 'Both cDCs and pDCs contribute to RA pathogenesis and disease progression by secreting a large number of cytokines, including TNF, IL-1, IL-12, IL-6, Interferons (IFNs) as well as differentiation factors, including macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) [14].': 42, 'Mature cDCs that produce high amounts of IL-12 and IL-23 have been reported in the infiltrates of synovial tissues of RA patients, suggesting that these cells have a role in the polarization of pathogenic T lymphocytes [31].': 37, 'Inflammatory DCs, which are recruited to sites of inflammation or infection, induce the secretion of IL-17 in naïve CD4 T cells through the secretion of TGFβ, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL- 23 [31,36].': 32, 'Activated cDCs also produce high levels of B lymphocyte activation and survival factors, such as BAFF and APRIL, which have a key role in B lymphocyte differentiation and antibody production (reviewed in Ref.': 33, '[37]).': 1, 'On the other hand, cDCs can play a tolerogenic role by controlling TReg differentiation [14].': 15, 'In mouse models of RA, injection of fully mature DCs loaded with collagen prevents collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) after the induction of a TH2 shift [38].': 25, 'In addition, immature DCs can expand and activate a novel regulatory population of CD49b+ T cells, with high immunosuppressive potential able to mediate protection against a systemic autoimmune disease [39].': 30, 'In summary DC-driven events have the ability to either induce tolerance or autoimmunity depending on the various cues they receive in the joint microenvironment.': 24, 'The phenotypic and functional plasticity of DCs highlight the complex and dichotomous role they might play in pathogenesis of RA.': 20, 'The role of neutrophils in RA\nNeutrophils are the first cells to reach the synovium and the most abundant leukocytes in inflamed joints [40].': 24, 'The importance of these cells in the initiation and progression of RA in patients as well as in murine models has been well documented.': 24, 'Neutrophils bind immune complexes on the synovium via their Fcγ receptors on the neutrophil membrane, triggering their degranulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [40,41].': 25, 'In RA pathology, this enhanced ROS generation by neutrophils at the site of inflammation causes endothelial dysfunction and tissue injury.': 20, 'Oxygen radicals cause DNA damage and oxidation of lipids, proteins, and lipoproteins and may be involved in immunoglobulin mutations that lead to formation of autoantibodies [42].': 26, 'Neutrophils also express the PADI4 enzyme responsible for the citrullination of arginine [43], and PADI4 deletion led to reduced disease severity as well as lower levels of autoantibodies and inflammatory cytokines in CIA mouse model [44].': 36, 'Normally, these cells have a short lifespan and undergo apoptosis after 6–18 h in circulation.': 15, 'However, a defect in neutrophil clearance causes apoptotic neutrophils to undergo secondary necrosis [45].': 14, 'The ingestion of this debris by macrophages then induces production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, consequently amplifying inflammation.': 16, 'In patients with early RA, synovial neutrophils show significantly decreased levels of apoptosis compared to patients with persistent forms of arthritis [46].': 22, 'A number of stimuli, including IL-8, TNF and GM-CSF can activate neutrophils [47].': 13, 'Activated neutrophils have been shown to secrete immune mediators including IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, TGF-β, TNF, oncostatin M and BLyS, triggering positive regulatory feedbacks, which lead to acute and persistent inflammation [40].': 31, 'Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which consist of chromatin and contents of neutrophil granules, are typically released by neutrophils upon interaction with a pathogen.': 23, 'In RA, citrullinated histones released in NETs can be recognized by ACPAs and thereby serve as autoantigens [48].': 18, 'Furthermore, synovial neutrophils of RA patients have a higher propensity to form NETs when induced with LPS or with certain ACPAs [49].': 22, 'To diminish the effects of neutrophils in RA pathogenesis, current pharmacological therapies targeting neutrophils in RA are aimed at minimizing its inflammatory status in the synovial fluid.': 27, 'There are a number of different agents used to treat RA including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), anti-TNF and anti-IL6 blocker [40].': 27, 'TNF has pleiotropic effects on inflammation and neutrophil functions, such as priming the neutrophil respiratory burst, increasing the expression levels of other cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules, and stimulating ROS production.': 31, 'Blocking TNF activity, therefore, has the effect of blocking downstream function of neutrophil activation [50].': 15, 'Several studies have demonstrated that NETs and their components are elevated in RA patients and can therefore be used as biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets [49].': 26, 'Indeed, a recent report showed that inhibiting NETs by a therapeutic anti-citrullinated protein antibody (tACPA) leads to enhanced clearance of NETs by macrophages, which then attenuated tissue damage in the joints of a CIA mouse model [51].': 37, 'Neutrophils play an integral role in RA and our ability to control its function will greatly diminish its ‘destructive’ features within the synovial space.': 24, 'The role of NK cells in RA\nThrough their cytolytic capacity and generation of cytokines and chemokines, natural killer (NK) cells are a type of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs; see below) that play a critical role in tumour surveillance and early host defense against viruses [52].': 46, 'A subset of NK cells accumulates in the inflamed RA synovial membrane and contributes to bone destruction.': 17, 'These cells are CD56bright and can promote TNF production by CD14+ monocytes in a contact-dependent manner when activated with IL-12, IL-15, or IL-18 [53].': 24, 'Other studies have shown increased expression of granzyme positive NK cells in early RA synovial fluid (Sf) compared with osteoarthritis [54].': 21, 'Granzyme B plays a role in promoting autoimmunity, generating new epitopes, and inducing direct cartilage damage.': 16, 'As such, high serum levels of granzyme B have been shown to act as an independent predictor of early erosion in RF-positive individuals [55].': 24, 'Recent studies began exploring differences in NK cell numbers, function and subsets between healthy donors and RA patients.': 18, 'Lin et al.': 3, 'characterized function and phenotypes of NK cells from peripheral blood of RA patients [56].': 14, 'They showed that NK cell percentage in PBMCs of RA patients is higher than that of controls.': 17, 'This may be due to the higher serum levels of IL-15 they observed in RA patients.': 16, 'They also found decreased expression of NKp46 and CD62L, but increased CD158b and CD158e expression on NK cells obtained from RA patients versus controls [56].': 25, 'Another study identified differentially expressed genes in NK cells obtained from RA patients versus healthy controls.': 16, 'NK cells isolated from patients with RA expressed higher mRNA levels of CD56, CXCL16, PECAM-1, ITGB7, BTK, TLR10, and IL-1β, but lower levels of CCL2, CCR4, RELA and IBTK [57].': 30, 'Yamin et al.': 3, 'showed that subpopulations of NK cells can vary depending on the severity of RA [58].': 15, 'Activated synovial fluid (Sf)-NK cells in patients with advanced RA constituted around 25% of all lymphocytes, a much higher proportion than those in patients with milder non-deformative disease [58].': 29, 'Together, these studies demonstrate that certain NK cell populations and genes can be used as biomarkers for RA progression or diagnosis.': 21, 'Overall, NK cells play an important role in RA pathogenesis and current investigations deciphering specific subtypes of these cells along with their function in relation to RA manifestation may reveal novel therapy targets.': 33, "The role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in RA\nInnate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play an important role in inflammatory diseases

absence of recombination activating gene (RAG)-dependent rearranged antigen-specific receptors [59].': 28, 'ILCs are mainly found at barrier surfaces in the body where they quickly respond to environmental stress signals, and play a role in tissue remodelling, protection against pathogens and tissue homeostasis [59,60].': 32, 'There are three different groups of innate lymphocytes (ILCs): ILC1, ILC2, ILC3 [59].': 13, 'NK cells, discussed above, belong to the first group.': 9, 'Abnormal activation of ILCs (other than NKs) have been shown to be the contributing factor to RA pathogenesis.': 18, 'So far, there has been a limited number of studies supporting a role for other ILCs in RA pathogenesis.': 19, 'A recent report examined lymph node (LN) biopsy specimens from patients in the earliest phases of RA.': 17, 'No difference was found in the frequency of total ILCs, but patients with RA had greater numbers of ILC1s and ILC3s in their LNs than the healthy controls, and patients at risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis had higher levels of ILC1.': 41, 'The findings indicate that prior to the development and during the earliest phases of RA, ILC distribution in LNs changes from a homeostatic profile toward a more inflammatory one [61].': 30, 'A more recent study, however, demonstrated that ILC3 CCR6+ cells contribute to RA inflammation via excessive IL-17 and IL-22 production.': 20, 'Samples taken from a CIA mouse model (compared to control mice) along with samples taken from the synovium of RA patients (compared to healthy controls) indicated increased levels of chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20), IL-17A, and IL-22 [62].': 37, 'The significance of IL-17 in the synovium of RA and juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients emphasizes a greater role for IL-17 in the overall manifestation of RA [63].': 27, 'In contrast to ILC1 and ILC3, ILC2 levels decrease in the synovium of RA patients, while their number is higher in the joints/circulation when RA patients are in remission.': 29, 'Further investigation showed that ILC2 control TReg activity.': 8, 'In mice, in the absence of ILC2 proliferation, TReg were inactive resulting in enhanced inflammation and bone erosion.': 18, 'ILC2-induced TReg activity led to resolution of inflammation and bone protection [64].': 12, 'This trend was consistent between mice and RA patients.': 9, 'In summary both NK cells and ILCs are major contributing cells to RA pathogenesis.': 14, 'Deviations from normal NK and ILCs functions and composition may influence the severity of RA manifestation.': 16, 'Innate immune signaling drives RA pathogenesis\nToll-like receptors (TLRs)\nTLRs play a central role in regulating innate immunity and in recent years their role in autoimmune diseases such as RA is becoming clearer.': 33, 'TLRs represent a family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and are the front-line sensors of danger signals that are released following injury or infection [14].': 25, 'It is postulated that harmful stimuli triggered by injury, infection, stress, hypoxia or cell death, ignite tissue damage and release of endogenous TLR ligands in the periphery.': 27, 'TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7 and TLR8 are highly expressed by RA peripheral blood monocytes and synovial macrophages, and ligation by their exogenous and endogenous ligands promotes inflammatory responses [65].': 29, 'The functions of TLR2 and TLR4 have been extensively studied in RA through the use of in vitro systems and experimental models.': 22, 'Several Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs), such as lipoarabinomannan (LAM), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), peptidoglycan (PGN), and other glycolipids, glycoproteins and lipoproteins, are activators of TLR2, while TLR4 is activated by LPS, as well as fungal mannan and glucuronoxylmannan [65].': 40, 'TLR2 expression is increased on peripheral blood CD16+ monocytes as well as on synovial fluid (SF)-macrophages of RA patients compared with health controls [66].': 24, 'Similarly, another group showed that TLR2 and TLR4 expression was higher on CD14+ SF macrophages of RA patients compared with healthy controls, and that TLR2 and TLR4 ligation led to increased activation of SF macrophages in vitro [67].': 38, 'A study investigating blood taken from RA patients showed significantly increased expression levels of TLR2 and IL-6 compared to healthy controls.': 21, 'However, TLR4 expression was not significantly different between RA and healthy controls [68] indicating a more critical role for TLR2 than TLR4 in RA pathogenesis.': 25, 'Indeed, the importance of TLR2 in RA pathogenesis was highlighted by its ability to induce synovial fibroblast migration, invasion and MMPs production in vitro [69].': 25, 'Although TLR2 and TLR4 function has been implicated in RA pathogenesis, there is conflicting information regarding association of SNPs of TLR2 and TLR4 with severity of RA [70,71].': 28, 'TLR5, which recognizes bacterial flagellin components, correlates with TNF levels and RA disease activity as measured by the DAS28, a clinical assessment of joint inflammation and other factors [72].': 29, 'Endosomal TLR3 is activated by viral double stranded (ds) RNA and can be activated by dsRNA coming from necrotic cells in the RA synovium [73].': 25, 'Altogether, the literature suggests that the pathogenic effect of TLR3 is due to its differential expression in RA compared to normal fibroblasts and its presence on myeloid cells is less significant for disease progression [74,75].': 35, 'Both TLR7 and TLR8 recognize ssRNA [76].': 7, 'While expression of TLR7 is enhanced by IL-17 and IL-8, LPS and IL-1 are responsible for increasing the TLR8 levels in RA monocytes and macrophages [76].': 26, 'TLR9 recognizes internalized bacterial DNA and non-methylated CpG oligonucleotides [77].': 10, 'Inhibition of TLR9 expression in a rat model of RA along with studies involving TLR9 deficient mice have shown delayed onset of arthritis and an overall reduced level of bone erosion [78].': 32, 'Regulation of TLR signaling pathways is very important for disease outcomes [30,65].': 12, 'TRAF1 in the TRAF1-C5 region is the third most strongly RA-associated locus in ACPA positive RA according to GWAS data [79].': 21, 'A follow up study showed that monocytes from healthy donors with disease associated TRAF1 SNPs were over-responsive to TLR4 stimulation and produced more pro-inflammatory cytokines.': 25, 'Mechanistically, the study revealed an unexpected role for TRAF1 in its negative regulation TLR signaling by interfering with linear ubiquitination of IKKγ (NEMO) [80].': 24, 'TLR2 and TLR4 expression levels can be regulated by microRNAs (miR), thereby affecting disease outcome.': 15, 'In RA patients, fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), which play a central role in osteoarticular destruction, express several TLRs but strongly upregulate TLR2 expression.': 22, 'Transfection of this key effector cell with miR-19a/b led to reduced TLR2 expression and thus an overall reduction in the production of IL-6 and matrix metalloproteinase 3 [81].': 28, 'Similarly, Jian et al.': 4, 'showed that miR-26a directly targets TLR3 leading to reduced inflammation and bone erosion in animal models of RA [82].': 19, 'In conclusion, binding of TLR ligands to responsive cells can lead to chronic inflammation that results in cartilage and bone destruction in RA.': 23, 'Novel approaches are currently being tested to target TLR expression and signaling as potential treatments for RA.': 17, 'Inflammasomes\nIL-1β and IL-18 are two potent cytokines that are released as a part of the innate defense mechanism to invading pathogens.': 22, 'However, excessive release of these cytokines, particularly IL-1β, is associated with autoimmune disorders and septic shock [83].': 17, "Therefore, it's not surprising that its secretion is tightly regulated, where it requires a second independent signal to be secreted.": 20, 'As with other cytokines, the first signal entails transcription of the IL-1β gene, but the gene product, pro-IL1β is not active.': 21, 'The second signal entails activation of the inflammasome, a multimeric protein complex typically comprised of a danger sensing receptor (NLR), an ASC adaptor protein and the zymogen pro-caspase-1 [84].': 29, 'Following inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 is activated and directs the cleavage of pro-IL1β and pro-IL18 into active and secreted IL-1β and IL-18, respectively.': 22, 'Due to the various complexities of danger signals, many different types of inflammasomes have evolved — each with its own danger receptor.': 22, 'The canonical inflammasome can be nucleated by the NLR members NLRP1, NLRP3 and NLRC4 or by the ALR member AIM2.': 20, 'Of the inflammasomes that have been described, the NLRP3 inflammasome stands out for the large number of “molecular patterns” it responds to and the large number of human diseases in which it has been implicated [85].': 36, 'Malfunctioning of the NLRP3 inflammasome is a driver of autoimmune diseases like gout, RA and lupus [86].': 17, 'Moreover, IL-1β has long been implicated in cartilage erosion and the prevention of chondrocyte matrix formation (reviewed in (Abramson and Amin, 2002)).': 22, 'Dysregulated activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been associated with inflammatory joint diseases like osteoarthritis and gout as well (reviewed in Ref.': 22, '[87,88]).': 1, 'However, the relationship between the NLRP3 inflammasome and RA is not conclusive.': 12, 'Various mouse models of RA have been employed to study the pathogenesis of RA and the efficacy of RA suppressive drugs.': 21, 'Zhang et al.': 3, 'employed a collagen induced arthritis (CIA) model and showed that increased synovial and serum NLRP3 expression increased in the early onset of CIA and directly correlated with disease severity [89].': 30, 'This conclusion was recently confirmed by another group indicating increased inflammasome activity in the synovia of RA patients and CIA mice.': 21, 'Increased inflammasome activity led to increased inflammatory signature associated with RA, whereas inhibition of inflammasome activity by MCC950 led to significantly lower inflammation [90].': 24, 'This is likely due to the local inflammatory nature of this model compared to CIA.': 15, 'Moreover, in the spontaneous RA model, A20Myel−KO, myeloid-cell specific deletion of the RA susceptibility gene A20/Tnfaip3, led to increased NLRP3 mediated caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion, which positively correlated with increased arthritis pathology in these mice.': 36, 'This phenotype was rescued by NLRP3, caspase-1 or IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) deletion [91].': 13, 'Choulaki et al.': 3, 'demonstrated that the NLRP3 inflammasome was overexpressed and overactivated in whole blood cell samples of human RA patients when compared to healthy controls [92].': 24, 'On the other hand, a previous study utilizing antigen induced arthritis (AIA) model showed that RA pathogenesis is dependent on ASC but independent of other inflammasome components such as NLRP3, NLRC4 and caspase-1 [93].': 34, 'This discrepancy might be due to a context dependent role for NLRP3 inflammasome or because other inflammasome, like NLRP1, play a more important or consistent role in RA pathogenesis (reviewed in Ref.': 32, '[88]).': 1, 'In addition to innate immune cells, TH17 cells of RA patients exhibited enhanced NLRP3 activation, which correlated with increased IL-1β and IL-17 levels in RA sera.': 26, 'Inhibition of NLRP3, caspase-1 and IL-1R led to decreased TH17 differentiation [94].': 12, 'These studies showcase the possibility of inflammasomes as a therapeutic target in RA patients.': 14, 'However, important mechanistic insights and key intracellular signaling pathways leading to inflammasome activation must be elucidated prior to this becoming a reality.': 22, 'Innate immune system as a treatment target for RA\nOver the past two decades, the treatment of RA has been revolutionized by advances in the understanding of its pathologic mechanisms and the development of drugs that target them.': 38, 'Biological agents that have been approved for RA therapy include antibodies that target TNF, IL-6 or IL-1β activity as well as therapeutics that block T cell function or deplete B cells.': 31, 'We have already discussed some of these potential therapies that target monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils above.': 16, 'However, more recent advances in the field of RA treatment enables novel therapeutic approaches that target TLRs, NLRP3 inflammasomes, ILCs and DCs.': 22, 'In spite of all this, there are subsets of RA patients that do not respond to the aforementioned strategies.': 19, 'RA is a complicated disease caused by many genetic and environmental factors.': 12, 'Therefore, the need persists for novel therapeutic approaches that are more tailored, effective and less expensive.': 16, 'A number of strategies can be utilized to abrogate TLR driven inflammatory responses.': 13, 'These strategies include: 1) use of soluble decoy receptors or neutralizing antibodies that abolish the ligand and receptor binding, 2) suppressing the production of endogenous ligands or TLR expression levels, 3) inhibiting TLR linked downstream pathways and 4) inhibiting TLR expression, in part through mi-RNAs.': 45, 'As TLRs play an integral role in the innate immune response, ‘controlling’ the overall contribution of these receptors can have major impact on RA manifestation.': 25, 'Specific receptor targeting can lead to diminished inflammation in RA patients.': 11, 'Given the complex roles that DCs play in RA pathogenesis, therapies targeting them are being developed to either block the immunogenic or enhance tolerogenic functions of DCs [95].': 28, 'In a recent study involving a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model, treatment of bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) with the TNF blocker, etanercept, led to delayed onset of arthritis and reduced arthritis symptoms [96].': 33, 'Following LPS stimulation, etanercept-treated BMDCs failed to mature and migrate to local lymph nodes resulting in overall reduced inflammatory cytokine production [96].': 22, 'On the other hand, therapies exploiting the tolerogenic abilities of DCs are currently under development.': 15, "Autologous ‘Tolerogenic’ DCs (TolDC) are derived from RA patient's own myeloid precursors ex vivo, loaded with antigen, and manipulated to suppress autoreactive T cells and then injected back into the patient's synovial joints.": 33, 'A Phase I clinical trial employing TolDCs showed the feasibility of this approach [97].': 14, 'Additional research is exploring how to optimize this process.': 9, 'For instance, maturation of TolDC in vitro after stimulation with PAMPs (Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPLA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) leads to enhanced stability of the tolerant phenotype as well as the ability to suppress CD4 T cell responses in an experimental arthritis model [98].': 43, 'Another group showed that preloading TolDC with heat shock proteins (HSP40-, HSP60- and HSP70-derived peptides) may be a promising tool to restore immune tolerance in RA patients by converting HSP-specific CD4 T cells into anti-inflammatory TReg [99].': 37, 'Future perspectives\nRecent studies discussed here demonstrate that major advances have been made towards our understanding of how innate immune cells and signaling drive RA pathogenesis and showcase the complexity of this disease.': 33, 'Specific therapeutic targeting the innate immune system as well as its effectors and components can lead to reduced incidence and may improve quality of life for RA patients.': 28, 'This, however, requires additional mechanistic studies that investigate how metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells shape their role in RA pathogenesis.': 23, 'This can potentially shed some light into how environmental factors like smoking, physical activity and infections alter the susceptibility to RA.': 21, 'Given the heterogenous nature of innate immune cells, especially monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, major advances in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) technology may be instrumental in identifying the contribution of the various innate immune cell subsets to RA pathogenesis.': 40, 'Such studies can potentially delineate the evolving role of these subsets throughout the course of the disease.': 17, 'Finally, studies examining how macrophage polarization in the inflamed joints as the disease progresses can offer significant insights into the complex and central role of these cells in RA.': 29, 'Abstract\nScience and commerce advance together and the stem cell field is no exception.': 14, 'With the promise of cures for conditions as diverse as cancer, autism, neural degeneration, organ replacement and addiction, long-term preservation of dental stem cells is a growth market.': 28, 'The

umbilical cords present unique practical and conflicting ethical challenges [1,2].': 20, 'However, the discovery of postnatal stem cell populations in the tooth pulp by Gronthos and Shi [3,4], around two decades ago, opened up new horizons to stem cell research and propelled the dental profession further into the exciting field of regenerative medicine.': 42, 'Post-natal stem cells are present in pulp from deciduous teeth (baby or milk teeth) lost - or exfoliated - by all children during the first 6–12 years of development and are also commonly available from orthodontic extraction of third molars (wisdom teeth) in adults.': 44, 'This review will primarily focus on the practical aspects of “tooth bank” services for storage of dental stem cells.': 19, 'Therapeutic stem cells\nStem cell populations are comprised of unspecialized cells with the ability to keep dividing, proliferating and thus surviving until they receive specific signals.': 26, 'The signals take the form of molecules secreted by cells at a site of growth, development, tissue damage or repair, into the blood stream or surrounding tissue.': 27, 'These chemoattractant messages cause the stem cells to home in to their source entering the tissue at that site where further chemical signals direct them to specialize.': 27, 'During growth or tissue renewal, they add to the overall tissue development and in tissue damage, they replace the damaged cells aiding the reparative process.': 25, 'Not all stem cells are equal however, designations based on regenerative capacity define each class into totipotent, pluripotent and multipotent [5].': 21, 'Totipotent cells have the potential to recapitulate an entire organism in utero and thus can differentiate into any cell type.': 20, 'Other stem cells, including early human embryonic stem cells, are termed “pluripotent”, meaning they can differentiate into any cell type but cannot recapitulate an entire living organism by themselves.': 29, 'Multipotent stem cells are able to differentiate into more than one type of cell in the body, for example nerve, muscle, bone, blood cells, but without the full regenerative capacity of pluripotent stem cells [6,7].': 35, 'Generally they specialize within one family of cells, for example either mesenchymal, neural or hematopoietic [5].': 16, 'With such remarkable capacity for growth and repair, it is little wonder that both medical and commercial interests have long-standing interest in the potential of stem cells.': 27, 'The use of bone marrow, containing hematopoietic (blood) stem cells, is established in cancer treatment and other therapies [[8], [9], [10]].': 21, 'However, compatible bone marrow is not always available.': 8, 'Embryonic stem cell therapy, another well studied source of these cells, has societal limitations due to ethical objections to the use of embryonic stem cells and has resulted in a divide that in the USA alone runs from allowing active research through to outright bans, depending on the state [11].': 50, 'This picture is broadly reflected worldwide; from controlled access to complete prohibition.': 12, 'One of the most exciting developments in recent stem cell science, following decades of embryonic stem cell research has been the demonstration of fully differentiated cells induced to de-differentiate then re-differentiate along a new lineage.': 35, 'These cells are termed induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC) and were the subject of the 2012 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine awarded to Shinya Yamanaka and John Gurdon who showed that iPSC regain many aspects of stemness [12,13].': 39, 'This opened the door wide to future stem cell therapy however at this time inducible stem cells are still in clinical development and while clinical trials are underway in Japan it may be far longer before wider international iPSC treatments are available [14].': 43, "It is little wonder then that a comparatively new source of stem cells, the dental pulp - a readily available, relatively non-invasive source of autologous (an individual's own) stem cells - has created such interest.": 35, 'Since their initial identification nineteen years ago, there remains much to learn about dental stem cell biology and the regenerative capacity of these cells.': 24, 'Many excellent reviews exist describing the multi-faceted biology of dental stem cells in tissue engineering [15,16].': 16, 'However little has been published recently about the process of dental stem cell banking, the remainder of this review examines some of the practical aspects of dental stem cell banking.': 30, 'What do the public know about dental stem cells?': 9, 'A broad search using the terms “tooth” and “stem cell” returns results dominated by companies and dental offices offering to collect extracted teeth and preserve the dental pulp stem cells within.': 31, 'Many of these web sites list as possibly benefiting from dental stem cell therapy pathologies as sweeping as diabetes, heart attack, cancer, autism, drug addictions and aging.': 27, 'Yet the research quoted in relation to these lists invariably cite either clinical trials for non-dental mesenchymal stem cells or pre-clinical studies for dental-derived stem cells.': 26, 'It is unclear whether this important difference is plain to even informed - but non-specialist - members of the public.': 20, 'In fact, there is abundant in vitro and in vivo evidence that dental pulp cells do have a high potential for therapeutic benefit but the clinical evidence, critical to the benefits implied by tooth banks, is sparse [17].': 38, 'And while it is beyond the scope of this review to recount the large body of pre-clinical work relating to dental stem cell biology a brief description of the sources and function of dental stem cells will help to explain the rise of commercial tooth banking or more accurately, long term storage of stem cells from baby and adult teeth.': 60, 'Oral tissue sources of stem cells\nA number of oral tissues have yielded discrete populations of stem cells (Fig.': 19, '2).': 1, 'The dental pulp of both adult dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) and Stem cells

Progenitor Cells; DFSC, Dental Follicle Stem Cells.': 39, 'SHED and DPSC\nTooth banking services focus on SHED and DPSC but are they appropriately functional stem cells?': 18, 'Gene expression and proteomic analyses show that DPSC broadly express much the same genes as the bone marrow stem cells [4,18].': 21, 'Both cell types reside in perviscular niches, ready to migrate to the site of need within the local tissue [19].': 20, 'One of the functional differences they display is an increased proliferative capacity for DPSC compared to bone marrow stem cells [20,21].': 21, 'Indeed, repeated studies have noted that SHED have even greater proliferative properties than DPSC and may have a greater propensity for survival than their adult counterparts [20,22,23].': 27, 'This property is significant when considering the small numbers of stem cells available within the confines of a tooth pulp.': 20, 'One of the primary services provided by dental stem cell banking companies is the expansion of the few cells isolated from the pulp to a number that could be therapeutically useful.': 31, 'However, it seems that other than a higher rate of proliferation and survival there is little functional difference between DPSC and SHED.': 22, 'Although protein analyses have shown some very specific differences in protein expression the capacity for either DPSC, SHED or SCAP - also pulp-derived cells - their ability to differentiate into specialized tissue seems quite similar [[24], [25], [26], [27]].': 39, 'They have the capacity to become cells of both soft and hard tooth tissue recapitulating dental pulp including endothelial cells and dentin secreting odontoblasts both critical to regenerating the integrity of a damaged tooth [[27], [28], [29]].': 37, 'SHED and DPSC appear to have a greater propensity to differentiate into neural cells compared to bone marrow cells [21,26].': 20, 'Unlike other mesenchymal stem cells, it appears clear now that dental pulp stem cells are derived from neural-crest tissue, and that neural cells such as Schwann cells and their precursors, have the capacity to migrate into the pulp chamber and become pulp stem cells able to produce dentin matrix material [30].': 51, 'In turn, isolated dental pulp cells - and other neural crest-derived dental stem cells such as PDLSCs, DFSCs and gingiva-derived stem cells - can become functional neurons with SHED again having a greater capacity to do so than DPSC [23,[31], [32], [33]].': 42, 'In vivo studies have demonstrated that implanted SHED can regenerate functional neurons, which is an exciting clinical prospect if successfully translated [[34], [35], [36]].': 24, 'Therefore, under experimental conditions SHED and DPSC are able to reconstitute human tissue in general and more complex dental tissues - such as pulp - specifically.': 26, 'Dental stem cells in vivo seem to repair damaged tissue in a variety of ways that include direct cell replacement and also release of cytokines and chemokines mediating immunomodulation, vascular remodeling by angiogenesis, synaptogenesis and apoptosis in target tissue [37].': 40, 'In addition to tissue repair, these secreted mediators may allow local stem cells to exert an immunomodulatory influence on tissue response to oral pathogens in the progression of oral diseases such as periodontitis [38,39].': 34, 'Recently demonstrated, dental stem cells also secrete nanoscale extracellular vesicles that may contribute to their therapeutic functions [39,40].': 18, 'These vesicles carry specifically packaged proteins, lipids and small RNA species and are taken up by, and capable of reprogramming, target cells.': 22, 'Yet, while stem cells from early tooth buds can generate entirely new teeth, and while dental stem cells may remediate specific lesions, growing any other replacement organs from these accessible dental pulp stem cells may yet be just out of reach [41,42].': 42, 'Carious teeth as a source for banked stem cells\nA proportion of deciduous teeth extracted are carious and so are bacterially infected; tooth-banking companies are divided over acceptance of diseased teeth.': 31, 'The scientific literature is similarly split.': 6, 'Werle et al.': 3, 'demonstrated that stem cells extracted from both carious and healthy deciduous teeth demonstrated equivalent capacity for tissue differentiation [43].': 19, 'In similar manner, Tsai et al.': 6, 'compared the efficiency of stem cell recovery from deciduous teeth in the absence or presence of caries of increasing levels of disease severity [44].': 24, 'They also concluded that stem cells could be isolated from carious teeth but with numbers in inverse correlation to the clinical severity of the caries.': 25, 'A greater than four-fold difference in successful stem cell isolation from healthy versus carious teeth was demonstrated.': 17, 'In contrast, Werle et al.': 5, 'noted only a 10% difference in successful stem cell isolation from carious versus healthy teeth.': 15, 'Studies of adult stem cells from healthy teeth and post-caries teeth with inflamed pulps confirmed that cell recovery was lower in the diseased teeth but that both sources of stem cells retained similar differentiation capacities [45,46].': 36, 'Notably, Tsai et al.': 4, 'reported an increase in both inflammatory mediator expression and of innate immune system molecules in stem cells from the diseased teeth compared to healthy.': 24, 'It is unclear how those differences may influence the long-term use of SHED or DPSC banked for regenerative purposes but it is reasonable to be cautious at the very least.': 30, 'The questions surrounding carious teeth clearly highlight the paucity of information regarding teeth as a source of banked stem cells.': 20, 'Tooth banking: the process\nAlthough stem cell banks collecting bone marrow and placental cord blood have been in operation for decades, banks specializing in stem cells isolated from teeth are relatively new in comparison.': 34, 'In North America, India and the United Kingdom in particular, dental stem cell banks are expanding in number.': 18, 'An English language internet search of the

specific tooth banking services however; no specific positive or negative opinion towards any individual dental stem cell banking service is intended or implied in this review.': 125, 'Collection\nMany collection protocols for dental stem cell banks are similar yet there are some notable and important differences in both sample requirements and sample processing.': 26, 'The majority of services recommend that a dentist extract the deciduous tooth as soon as it is loose.': 18, 'In contrast, BioEden (www.Bioeden.com) claim to use a process for collection and transport optimized for naturally exfoliated teeth (Table 1).': 20, 'Indeed their transport medium for the tooth is pasteurized cow milk, an interesting choice discussed further below.': 17, 'For the other services accepting teeth from home extractions the requirement that the tooth have an existing blood supply - evidenced by post removal bleeding - is common to most.': 30, 'For all the Indian tooth banks and five of the US tooth banks extraction by a dental professional is required.': 20, 'Professional extraction shortens the time the tooth is out of physiological conditions likely to preserve the pulp tissue.': 18, 'While there is modest literature on the preservation of whole teeth specifically for banking stem cells, there is a long history of avulsed tooth preservation, that is, preservation of teeth lost to physical trauma for re-implantation [48].': 37, 'The requirement for overall survival of healthy tissue makes avulsed tooth data a useful guide for survival of the entire tooth tissue, including pulp.': 24, 'Long-term success rates for re-implantation of avulsed teeth range from around 20% to above 90% depending on how the tooth was handled and how the patient was treated post implant [49,50].': 31, 'However, the readiness of an otherwise healthy tooth for extraction and the manner in which it is extracted are not the primary factors concerning tooth-banking services.': 26, 'Once a tooth has been extracted or exfoliated, storage for transport has the biggest impact on living pulp, and therefore stem cell survival.': 23, 'Transport\nA number of studies have evaluated different media for successful preservation of live teeth although many are ex vivo models and have looked at the specific survival of periodontal ligament cells after tooth storage in the media.': 38, 'Of the tooth banking services that describe the transport medium, balanced salt solutions such as phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or hanks buffered saline solution (HBSS) predominate with mention of undefined nutrients.': 31, 'As mentioned above, BioEden calls for the use of bovine milk as the transport medium.': 15, 'Avulsed teeth are often recommended to be brought to the dentist in milk or even held in the mouth with saliva acting as the carrier [51].': 26, 'In the short term, tissue drying is the greatest enemy to successful tooth recovery and the same is likely true for stem cell recovery from banked teeth.': 27, 'Times varying from overnight up to 48 h are presented as maximum transport times from tooth extraction to receipt by the banking facility.': 23, 'Yet simply keeping the tooth hydrated, in water for example, is insufficient to that purpose instead an isotonic fluid mimicking physiological conditions is required [52,53].': 25, 'Bovine milk meets a number of practical standards that are absent from many other media [54].': 16, 'It is biocompatible, has neutral pH and is naturally buffered but most critically, dental tissue demonstrably survives in it and teeth can be successfully re-implanted if milk is used as a carrier [52,55,56].': 33, 'Importantly, it is commonly available.': 5, 'This is more important for the unplanned loss of teeth by avulsion but still also, perhaps to a lesser extent, for exfoliated teeth where the tooth is shed at home, school or anywhere other than the dental clinic.': 38, 'Bovine milk is still the most widely recommended preservation media for avulsed tooth storage during transport to the dentist [57].': 20, 'Other biological media investigated for tooth preservation include propolis (a honeybee natural product), soymilk, almond milk, pomegranate and other fruit juices, chicken egg white, coconut water, green tea extract, Gatorade sports drink and the Brazilian plant extract Dragon Blood Croton Lechleri sap [[58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63]].': 48, 'For the most part and with the possible exception of Gatorade, these non-defined media have proven viable as tooth tissue preservation vehicles yet none standing out as consistently better than milk.': 31, 'Closely following bovine milk in frequency of recommendation is HBSS, which is commonly used for tissue and cell preservation and maintenance under in vitro experimental conditions [57].': 27, 'Notably, HBSS is the medium contained in the tooth preservation kit, Save-a-Tooth™ the kit officially used by the tooth bank Store-A-Tooth [57,64].': 22, 'The main apparent benefit of HBSS, and similar saline solutions is that they are of a defined and consistent formulation, unlike milk [56].': 23, 'For tooth banks requiring the use of their proprietary collection media kits and preferred or required extraction by a dentist it is this matter of consistency that drives the tooth preservation process.': 32, 'Stem cell isolation and preparation\nSuccessfully obtaining viable cells is the critical step in this process although most tooth banks do not publicize their proprietary isolation processes.': 27, 'Stem cells are generally extracted from the pulp by mechanical and enzymatic preparation of single cell populations or alternatively by tissue outgrowth - where cells are allowed to naturally migrate from the extracted pulp onto plastic culture surfaces (Fig.': 39, '3).': 1, 'In early studies on the isolation and characterization of dental pulp stem cells, Songtao Shi and Stan Gronthos enzymatically digested the pulp tissue with collagenase type 1 and dispase - to free cells from the extracellular matrix - then they passed them through a 70 μm sieve.': 47, 'Single cells were able to grow in culture thereafter [3].': 10, 'This recovery protocol is still used essentially unchanged two decades later [65,66].': 12, 'Given the rapidity of this process, 24–48 h from start to finish, this protocol of is likely employed with minor variation by most of the tooth banks.': 27, 'The primary alternative method reported commonly in the literature, tissue outgrowth, is a simpler yet lengthier protocol where the pulp tissue is macerated and then placed in a culture vessel in balanced salt solution with appropriate nutrients to maintain stemness.': 40, 'The cells migrate out from the tissue and establish colonies on the plastic culture surface [44,67].': 16, 'In both cases, the population of cells surviving in culture is greatly enriched in stem cells following two or three rounds of subculture.': 23, '3\nDownload : Download high-res image (627KB)Download : Download full-size image\nFig.': 12, '3.. Summary of dental pulp stem cell isolation processes.': 9, 'Stem cells are routinely collected from pulp tissue, by tissue outgrowth (left) or enzymatic digestion (right).': 16, 'In both cases, the resulting populations are tested for viability, contamination and often the presence of stem cell markers using flow cytometry.': 22, 'Viable cells are then cryopreserved.': 5, 'However, the presence of stem cells needs to be tested and the tooth banks detailing their processes mention both viability testing - testing the cell population for number of living versus dead cells - and flow cytometry (Store-a-Tooth).': 38, 'Flow cytometry is a common analytical technique requiring only a few thousand cells out of the entire sample [68].': 19, 'This is critical as pulp tissue volumes vary between incisors and molars but are consistently small in deciduous teeth.': 19, 'Cells can be simultaneously labelled by fluorescent molecular probes or antibodies, which could include markers for viability and also stem cell-specific markers.': 22, 'All tooth-banking services test cell viability but stem cell marker testing may not be performed unless explicitly noted.': 18, 'The reason for this is possibly that excessive handling of the pulp-derived cells in the early stages of isolation could result in loss of stemness or viability [69].': 28, 'At least one company, The National Dental Pulp Laboratory tooth bank, state that they adhere to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) non-binding regulatory guidance on minimal handling of cell and tissue based products for homologous use.': 38, 'Homologous use refers to use of collected tissue for the same purpose that tissue would have served in the system from which it was extracted.': 25, 'For extracted cells this means, in the words of the FDA, “… processing that does not alter the relevant biological characteristics of cells or tissues.“.': 25, 'Cryopreservation\nOnce viable cells or pulp tissue have been isolated they must be successfully frozen and stored.': 17, 'Cells are suspended in a preservation medium, possibly containing growth factors and a cryoprotectant, commonly dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) which inhibits the growth of ice crystals that may disrupt the cell membrane and so reduce overall viability.': 36, 'They are transferred to specialized cryo-vials generally constructed from high-density polypropylene then the samples are frozen and placed in low temperature storage containers filled with liquid nitrogen.': 27, 'The freezing process and storage, when reported by the banking service, is similar to standard procedures common to research laboratories.': 20, 'It comprises a slow or staged freezing process followed by long term storage in the presence of liquid nitrogen which maintains the samples below −195.8 °C/-320.5 °F.': 27, 'There is a significant body of literature looking at the cryogenic preservation of dental tissue from initial studies simply demonstrating that DPSC can be frozen and successfully recovered, to comparison of cryogenically frozen whole pulp tissue and isolated DPSC/SHED, and to technological improvements for the freezing process [47,[70], [71], [72], [73]].': 51, 'The majority of tooth banks store isolated, viable stem cells but at least one, Store-A-Tooth, mentions the preservation of at least some of the original pulp material along with the isolated cells.': 32, 'Although whole tooth storage for future recovery of stem cells has proven technically possible, the efficiency of stem cell recovery is highly variable and it is not in general use by commercial banking services [[73], [74], [75], [76]].': 38, 'Preservation of extracted, intact pulp tissue likewise is not offered by banking services but it is comparable, post-cryopreservation, to fresh pulp for recovery of stem cells [69,76,77].': 27, 'Indeed both in vitro and in vivo functions are maintained if stem cells are recovered from frozen pulp tissue [69,73,77].': 20, 'However, from a commercial perspective it seems desirable to be able to reassure a paying client that viable stem cells are definitely being preserved.': 24, 'This is likely the reason that most banking services isolate cells and, at a minimum, verify cell viability and lack of contamination or test for the presence of stem cell markers.': 31, 'Interestingly, Lizier et al.': 4, 'developed a protocol for greatly scaling up the numbers of extracted stem cells from pulp tissue prior to freezing in which the same piece of pulp tissue is transferred from culture plate to culture plate seeding each of them in turn with stem cells over a number of days [78].': 50, 'Under these conditions, cells maintained stemness throughout the process suggesting that dental stem cells and pulp tissue are relatively resistant to handling and manipulation if done carefully.': 27, 'Notably, this group demonstrated that these Immature Dental Pulp Stem Cells (IDPSC) are a stem population distinct from SHED or DPSC gathered from equivalent pulps [79].': 26, 'Gradual, staged freezing at -1 °C per minute is a standard both in experimental cell culture and also for cell banks.': 21, 'Digital freezers allow the gradual and controlled reduction in temperature and once frozen the cells are transferred to a dewar containing liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.': 26, 'That said, both Woods et al.': 6, 'and Kumar et al.': 4, 'demonstrated that both gradual yet uncontrolled freezing and long term storage at higher temperatures of −80 °C had no detrimental effect on DPSCs compared to controlled freezing and storage under liquid nitrogen suggesting again that dental stem cells are remarkably robust [69,80].': 42, 'At the other extreme vitrification, instant freezing, results in optimal recovery of embryonic stem cells although some evidence suggests that rapid freezing is not optimal for dental stem cells [75,81].': 30, 'In addition, the application of magnetic fields during the freezing has been shown to increase the viability of frozen cells.': 20, 'Freezing causes ice-crystal formation and a combination of rapid dehydration, excessive osmotic and physical disruption of the plasma membrane by the crystals can occur [82].': 25, 'Importantly, application of magnetic fields allow reduction in the concentration of cryoprotective - yet cytotoxic - DMSO in the cryopreservative medium towards a higher cell recovery on thawing [75,83].': 29, 'A fuller discussion of the technical aspects of stem cell cryopreservation and the selection of cryoprotective agent is available in two excellent reviews [84,85].': 24, 'The cost of banking\nAlthough the technical aspects of the banking process must concern a potential patient or their parent, there is generally insufficient, information available from the public face of the tooth banks to allow members of the public to differentiate between services.': 44, 'Their decision will likely be strongly influenced by both local availability and the commercial or rather, financial differences between banking facilities.': 21, 'Notably, health insurance plans in the USA do not currently cover long-term stem cell preservation and it is not a standard service in most countries with national health services.': 29, 'As prices are subject to change and as there are multiple types of plan available, a direct cost comparison may be meaningless, however as a guide the initial processing can cost in the range of $500 - $2000 (US dollars) and annual maintenance from $99 - $264.': 47, 'Some services offer a flat rate of around $2000 - $3000 for a 20-year plan with no annual maintenance costs.': 20, 'Indeed this is the sole offering from Oothy, with the idea that stem cell preservation from deciduous teeth is intended as a long-term therapeutic investment.': 25, 'So basing a choice of service on the overt cost is clearly a complicated and daunting prospect and it still does not take into account the exact services offered by each tooth bank.': 33, 'For example, NDPL, Oothy, and Stem-Save will accept multiple teeth at the same time whereas BioEden and Tooth Bank have no extra charge for processing teeth until successful stem cell isolation is achieved.': 33, 'Some services offer a refund if the entire process is unsuccessful and some offer credit for future teeth.': 18, 'Accreditation and security are other incalculable factors and while each facility assures security for the cryopreservation facilities, liquid nitrogen storage and patient confidentiality it would be impractical for an individual consumer to make a comparison based on those parameters.': 39, 'Ultimately, it is a reasonable likelihood that dentists or other parents will introduce new consumers to the concept of dental stem cell banking and will likely recommend their own affiliated banking services, and that this will be the strongest influence on any such decision.': 44, 'Conclusion\nGiven the rate of technical innovation over the last century, it is impossible to predict the medical advances over the life span of a child with dental stem cells stored right now.': 33, 'So, are the costs of banking stem cells warranted and reasonable, based on current knowledge?': 15, 'If money is no object then the answer is likely yes.': 11, 'However, it is quite possible that medical genomics, biotechnology, nanotechnology, DNA editing and even traditional pharmaceutical sciences will successfully answer therapeutic questions that we might think to address with stem cells at this time.': 34, 'It is clear that hematopoietic, bone marrow and cord blood stem cells already provide viable solutions to some medical challenges.': 20, 'Moreover, dental stem cells, a source more readily available than those others also demonstrate exciting functionality in vivo and in vitro.': 21, 'The potential of dental stem cells is unquestionable but much more needs to be understood about these cells towards their practical, therapeutic use.': 23, 'Ultimately, it will be the patient or parent who will decide the fate of stem cell banking as an enterprise; yet cost and the Tooth Fairy aside there can be little reason not to bank dental stem cells.': 38, 'Abstract\nBackground\nNew therapeutic options to address the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are urgently needed.': 17, 'One possible strategy is the repurposing of existing drugs approved for other indications as antiviral agents for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).': 23, 'Due to the commercial unavailability of SARS-CoV-2 drugs for treating COVID-19, we screened approximately 250 existing drugs or pharmacologically active compounds for their inhibitory activities against feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FIPV) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), a human coronavirus in the same genus (Betacoronavirus) as SARS-CoV-2.': 46, 'Methods\nFIPV was proliferated in feline Fcwf-4 cells and HCoV-OC43 in human HCT-8 cells.': 14, 'Viral proliferation was assayed by visualization of cytopathic effects on the infected Fcwf-4 cells and immunofluorescent assay for detection of the nucleocapsid proteins of HCoV-OC43 in the HCT-8 cells.': 29, 'The concentrations (EC50) of each drug necessary to diminish viral activity to 50% of that for the untreated controls were determined.': 21, 'The viabilities of Fcwf-4 and HCT-8 cells were measured by crystal violet staining and MTS/PMS assay, respectively.': 17, 'Results\nFifteen out of the 252 drugs or pharmacologically active compounds

coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected over 2,970,000 people and killed more than 206,000 in 213 countries since the first outbreak in WuHan, China [1] was reported in December 2019.': 41, 'To control this disease, effective treatments, including SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, are being actively pursued [1].': 14, 'One potentially efficient approach is the repurposing of drugs previously approved to treat other diseases, since they are immediately available for use in clinical trials with COVID-19 patients and have known safety profiles.': 33, 'Coronavirus (CoV) has a large genome and its mutation rate is higher than that of other RNA viruses [2,3].': 19, 'Animal CoVs cause persistent enzootic infections that inevitably infect new host species and become zoonotic, as happened for SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.': 27, 'Due to the diversity and relentlessness of these viruses, their individual mitigation is difficult [4]; and therefore broad-spectrum inhibitors of emerging and endemic CoVs are needed, especially for those prone to be periodically cycling in and out of humans and livestock.': 41, 'Therefore, the small molecule inhibitors, either old drugs or new chemical entities, were actively pursued and developed aiming to prevent or cure the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]].': 37, 'Previous work established the clinical efficacy of pegylated interferon-α-2a, ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir for the treatment of the MERS-CoV [15,16].': 19, 'Therefore, the strategy of repurposing existing drugs to treat patients infected with novel or zoonotic CoV has been validated and merits consideration in the contest of tackling the SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 pandemic.': 32, 'Two representative CoVs were selected for existing drugs to be tested against.': 12, 'Feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FIPV) belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus and causes enteritis in domestic and wild cats.': 18, 'Approximately 5–15% of infected cats develop feline infectious peritonitis, which is usually fatal [17,18].': 14, 'The pathogenesis, epidemiology, and pulmonary lesions associated with FIPV are similar to those associated with human SARS [19].': 18, 'Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) belongs to the same viral genus (Betacoronavirus) as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, infects humans and cattle, and is one of the viruses responsible for the common cold [20,21].': 31, '252 old drugs or pharmacologically active compounds were assessed for their inhibitory activity of FIPV [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]], of which 23 were found to exhibit some anti-FIPV activity and advanced to testing against HCoV-OC43.': 43, 'In total, 15 exerted an inhibitory effect on both FIPV and HCoV-OC43 and they turned out are old drugs.': 19, 'These included chloroquine, which was recently demonstrated to be capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and exhibited some efficacy in the clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients [22].': 27, 'Moreover, GS-441524, the active metabolite of remdesivir [23,24] which is currently being investigated in clinical trials for severe cases of COVID-19 [24,25], also exerted potent inhibitory activities against both FIPV and HCoV-OC43 herein.': 33, "Materials and methods\nCells, viruses,

'Food by nature is biological.': 5, 'It is capable of supporting the growth of microbials that are potential sources of foodborne diseases.': 16, 'Viruses are more responsible for the majority of foodborne illnesses but hospitalizations and deaths associated with foodborne infections are due to bacterial agents.': 23, 'The illnesses range from mild gastroenteritis to neurologic, hepatic, and renal syndromes caused by either toxin from the disease-causing microbe.': 20, 'Foodborne bacterial agents are the leading cause of severe and fatal foodborne illnesses.': 13, 'Over 90% of food-poisoning illnesses are caused by species of Staphylococcus, Salmonella, Clostridium, Campylobacter, Listeria, Vibrio, Bacillus, and E. coli.': 20, 'For instance, in the US and France, in the last decade of the 20th century, Salmonella was the most frequent cause of bacterial foodborne illness accounting for 5700 to 10,200 cases, followed by Campylobacter for 2600 to 3500 cases and Listeria for 304 cases [15].': 45, '•\nChemical Safety.': 3, 'Nonfood grade chemical additives, such as colorants and preservatives, and contaminants, such as pesticide residues, have been found in foods.': 20, 'Some food samples had higher levels of heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, arsenic, mercury, and copper than average food samples, suggesting possible leaching from the utensils and inadequate food hygiene.': 31, '•\nPersonal Hygiene.': 3, 'Poor personal hygiene practices of food handler and preparers pose considerable risks to personal and public health.': 17, 'Simple activities such as thorough hand washing and adequate washing facilities can prevent many foodforne illnesses.': 16, '•\nEnvironmental Hygiene.': 3, 'Inadequate recycling and waste disposal equipment and facilities lead to the accumulation of spoiled and contaminated food.': 17, 'This leads to an increased pest and insect population that can result in risk of food contamination and spoilage.': 19, 'Poor sanitary conditions in the area where foods are processed and prepared contribute to poor food storage and transport as well as selling of unhygienic food.': 26, 'Why is safe food supply important?': 6, 'A safe food supply is important because of significant disease burden as well as economic burden to the society and nation.': 21, 'In US alone, foodborne illnesses each year result in 325,000 hospitalizations and 5000 deaths [16].': 15, 'Worldwide, it has been estimated that more than one billion (1,000,000,000) episodes of food poisoning-related diarrhea occur annually [16]; these poisonings are responsible for the deaths of about 3 million children a year, mostly in underdeveloped regions.': 37, 'Foodborne illnesses associated with microbial pathogens or other food contaminants pose serious health threat in developing and developed countries.': 19, 'WHO estimates less than 10% of foodborne illness cases are reported whereas less than 1% of cases are reported in developing nations [17].': 23, 'In a recent report, WHO estimates 600 million foodborne illnesses and 420,000 deaths in 2010.': 15, 'The most frequent causes of foodborne illness were diarrheal disease agents, particularly norovirus and Campylobacter spp.': 16, 'Other major causes of foodborne deaths were Salmonella typhi, Taenia solium, hepatitis A virus, and mycotoxins especially aflatoxins [18], [19].': 20, 'Children are disproportionately bearing this burden - accounting for an estimated half of foodborne illness cases annually.': 17, 'Children are also among those most at risk of associated death and serious lifelong health complications from foodborne diseases.': 19, 'They are at high risk for foodborne illness for a number of reasons.': 13, 'Children have developing immune systems that are not always well equipped to fight infection; they are often smaller in size than adults, reducing the amount of pathogen needed to make them sick; and children have limited control over their diets and lack the developmental maturity necessary to carefully judge food safety risks.': 52, 'From economic perspective, access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food is crucial to sustaining life, promoting good health and economic growth.': 23, 'According to one study, the average cost per case of foodborne illness (in US dollars) was $1626 for the enhanced cost-of-illness model and $1068 for the basic model.': 28, 'The resulting aggregated annual cost of illness was $77.7 billion and $51.0 billion for the enhanced and basic models, respectively.': 20, 'The study defines basic cost-of-illness model to include economic estimates for medical costs, productivity losses, and illness-related mortality.': 18, 'The enhanced cost-of-illness model replaces the productivity loss estimates with a more inclusive pain, suffering, and functional disability measure based on monetized quality-adjusted life year estimates [20].': 27, 'Major foodborne illnesses and burden\nAccording to US Centers for Disease Control, foodborne diseases cause an estimated 48 million illnesses each year in the United States, including 9.4 million caused by known pathogens.': 33, 'The pathogen-commodity pairs most commonly responsible for outbreaks were scombroid toxin/histamine and fish (317 outbreaks), ciguatoxin and fish (172 outbreaks), Salmonella and poultry (145 outbreaks), and norovirus and leafy vegetables (141 outbreaks).': 32, 'The pathogen-commodity pairs most commonly responsible for outbreak-related illnesses were norovirus and leafy vegetables (4011 illnesses), Clostridium perfringens and poultry (3452 illnesses), Salmonella and vine-stalk vegetables (3216 illnesses), and C. perfringens and beef (2963 illnesses) [21], [22].': 37, 'Examples of unsafe food that commonly contain these hazards include uncooked foods of animal origin, fruits and vegetables contaminated with feces, raw shellfish and industrial pollution.': 26, 'In a comprehensive estimation, the 2015 WHO report not only provides numbers of foodborne illnesses in terms of incidence but also number of deaths and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) as a measure of burden due to foodborne related morbidity and mortality.': 42, 'The DALYs data are based on the metrics established by WHO and are consistent with the Global Burden of Disease project [18].': 22, 'Together, these foodborne hazards caused an enormous human burden of 33 millions DALYs with 40% among children younger than 5 year-old.': 21, 'With substantial global burden of foodborne diseases and deaths, the impact is most significant among young children living in low income regions where food hygiene and water sanitation are below optimal standards.': 32, 'Therefore, improving microbial, personal, chemical and environmental health will improve overall health of children and adults alike.': 17, 'It should be noted that antimicrobial overuse and misuse in veterinary and human medicine has been linked to the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria, rendering the treatment of infectious diseases ineffective in animals and humans [24].': 37, 'From a global perspective, most foodborne pathogens and toxins, along with morbidity, mortality and health burden are summarized in Table 1.': 21, 'Commonly encountered microbial pathogens and toxins include the following categories.': 10, 'A brief description of their illnesses is provided below for a quick reference.': 13, '•\nBacteria: Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHE coli) are

watery diarrhea, which may lead to severe dehydration and possibly death.': 18, 'Rice, vegetables, millet gruel and various types of seafood have been implicated in cholera outbreaks.': 15, '•\nViruses: Norovirus infections are characterized by nausea, explosive vomiting, watery diarrhea and abdominal pain.': 15, 'Food handlers infected with Hepatitis A virus are common source of contamination and spreads typically through raw or undercooked seafood or contaminated raw produce.': 24, '•\nParasites: Some parasites, such as fish-borne trematodes, are only transmitted through food.': 13, 'Others, for example Echinococcus spp, may infect people through food or direct contact with animals.': 15, 'Other parasites, such as Ascaris, Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba histolytica or Giardia, enter the food chain via water or soil and can contaminate fresh produce.': 23, '•\nWorms: Cestodes, nematodes, trematodes and helminths are worms most prevalent in regions where food preparation and storage, personal hygiene, water sanitation and environmental health are not routinely practiced Even though worm related foodborne illness are not as fatal as virus and bacteria, they account for a substantial burned to foodborne disability.': 52, '•\nChemicals: Naturally occurring toxins and environmental pollutants have caused many outbreaks.': 12, 'In addition, chemical residues used to eradicate or control pests and worms can be an independent risk of foodborne hazard.': 20, 'Mycotoxins, marine biotoxins, cyanogenic glycosides and poisonous mushrooms are all natural toxins.': 12, 'Staple foods like corn or cereals can contain high levels of mycotoxins, such as aflatoxin and ochratoxin.': 17, 'A long-term exposure can affect the immune system and normal

concern and a mounting burden on the healthcare system [2].': 23, 'According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, periodontal disease is considered to be a worldwide pandemic, causing disability, speech impairment, low self-esteem, and reduced quality of life [2].': 31, 'The study of periodontal pathogens and inflammation has attracted the attention from researchers outside of dentistry due to the potential influence of periodontitis on initiation and/or progression of several systemic diseases.': 31, 'Over the years, evidence has accumulated that links oral diseases with many non-oral and systemic diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, respiratory tract infection, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and neurodegenerative disease [3], [4], [5].': 35, 'For the most part, however, it remains to be established whether specific periodontal pathogens stimulate development of the systemic disease, or if the systemic disease causes the abundance of periodontal pathogens to change.': 33, 'If the pathogens cause non-oral disease, then they would represent obvious targets for therapeutic intervention.': 15, 'But as a minimum, the presence of periodontal pathogens could be used as diagnostic markers to predict susceptibility to non-oral disease.': 21, 'Periodontal pathogens could promote development of non-oral disease directly or indirectly.': 11, 'For example, about 30 abundant species in the oral cavity, mainly Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, are known to produce endotoxins, which could directly contribute to systemic disease [6].': 27, 'Migration of oral pathogens to the blood stream could also occur in some cases, such as following surgical procedures.': 19, 'Bacterial accumulation on the teeth due to poor dental

periodontal pathogens and bacteremia\nThe most common Gram-negative bacterial genera in the oral cavity include Treponema, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Capnocytophaga, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, Actinobacillus, and Eikenella [6], [8].': 29, 'Early studies identified Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Tannerella forsythia as causative agents in periodontal disease [9], and much of the research on periodontal disease continues to focus on these microorganisms.': 31, 'However, more recent studies have determined that the oral cavity contains approximately 500–700 prevalent taxa; this microbial community is referred to as the oral microbiota, oral microflora, or oral microbiome [8], [10].': 32, 'The oral microbiota is present in saliva, on gingival epithelium and other inner surfaces of the oral cavity and concentrated in dental plaque.': 23, 'The dental plaque is an organized biofilm of microorganisms that are either attached to the tooth surface or to other microorganisms in a way that allows the microorganisms to survive and resist host defense mechanisms or antibiotic treatment [11].': 39, 'As the biofilm matures, microbial dysbiosis occurs, causing a progressive shift from Gram-positive to predominantly Gram-negative anaerobic species, and resulting in biofilm formation under the gingival surface [12].': 28, 'Additionally, sugar metabolism by the dental plaque biofilm leads to production of organic acids, which play a crucial role in pH reduction and demineralization of the tooth surface [13].': 29, 'Thus, frequent sugar consumption is also known to induce dysbiosis of the supragingival microbiota, promoting development of carious lesions [12].': 20, 'Tissue trauma, flossing, dental procedures,

forsythia, was found in human atherosclerotic plaques, suggesting that these oral pathogens may migrate from the oral cavity to distant sites of the body [20], [21].': 43, 'More recently, studies in an animal model of atherosclerosis using hyperlipidemic mice infected with P. gingivalis and Treponema denticola demonstrated that infection with these bacteria is associated with alveolar bone loss and aortic atherosclerosis [22], [23].': 36, 'After oral infection, P. gingivalis and T. denticola induced a systemic immune response, and bacterial genomic DNA was found in the oral epithelium, aorta and within systemic organs [22], [23].': 30, 'Additionally, P. gingivalis evades innate immune detection via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, facilitating chronic inflammation in the vasculature [24].': 18, 'It was also demonstrated that P. gingivalis, by means of its secreted outer membrane vesicles, can induce platelet aggregation in human samples, which could be responsible for thrombus formation in vivo [25].': 32, 'Interestingly, other oral pathogens such as A. actinomycetemcomitans, T. forsythia, C. rectus, F. nucleatum, P. intermedia and T. denticola failed to aggregate platelets when tested for aggregation activity [26], suggesting that only P. gingivalis expresses virulence factors that can induce platelet aggregation.': 42, 'In summary, several oral pathogens are associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease in humans, and studies in mice support the possibility that infection with the oral pathogens may lead to the disease.': 34, 'Respiratory tract infection and

extrapulmonary sites.': 23, 'The oral cavity, especially saliva and dental plaque in patients with periodontal disease, seems to be a logical source for pathogens to accumulate and spread to the lower airways.': 29, 'Several oral pathogens have already been implicated in lung infections, including A. actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces israelii, Capnocytophaga spp, Chlamydia pneumoniae, E.

bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the same patients in the intensive care unit were shown to be genetically the same, which reinforces the view that dental plaque could serve as a significant reservoir for respiratory pathogens [30].': 43, 'In fact, individuals with periodontitis are three times more likely to develop nosocomial pneumonia, compared with patients without periodontitis [31].': 20, 'In an intratracheal mouse model of infection, P. gingivalis was responsible for persistent inflammatory responses in the lungs involving cell recruitment and proinflammatory cytokine production [27].': 26, 'Interestingly, a study with 40 subjects undergoing orotracheal intubation showed large quantities of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis and T. forsythia in toothed and toothless patients, suggesting that the oral environment, even without teeth, presents favorable conditions for pathogenic bacterial accumulation [32].': 41, "The common oral pathogens F. nucleatum

cross-sectional study of students presenting acute sore throat detected F. necrophorum in 20.5% of subjects and 9.4% of asymptomatic individuals, which was approximately twice as often as the usually investigated group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (10.3% of patients and 1.1% of asymptomatic subjects) [33].': 45, 'These studies suggest that Fusobacterium is a potential pathogen of the lungs and should be taken into account when investigating airway complications.': 22, 'Conversely, C. pneumoniae is well-studied as a respiratory pathogen and has been associated with asthma, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [34].': 22, 'This pathogen has also been found in the oral cavity [35], [36] and could probably translocate from the oral cavity to the lower airways, from where it could disseminate systemically to other sites such as spleen, heart, and aorta via monocytes through blood circulation, as suggested in a mouse model [37].': 51, 'Furthermore, C. pneumoniae infection has been associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis development [38], which could provide another mechanism whereby pathogens in the oral cavity contribute to atherosclerosis.': 29, 'Together, these studies demonstrate that unhealthy oral cavities can predispose to respiratory infections and suggest that oral or non-oral pathogens present in the oral cavity could contribute to respiratory disease.': 30, 'Oral and colorectal cancer\nCancer accounts for one out of four deaths every year, costing the US approximately $100 billion in healthcare besides the emotional and

levels in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) [44] and esophagus squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients, but not in healthy mucosa [41].': 32, 'The potential role for periodontal pathogens in the induction of oral cancer was confirmed in an oral-specific chemical carcinogenesis animal model [45].': 22, 'The study showed that the periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum stimulate tumorigenesis via direct interaction with oral epithelial cells, and that the effect is mediated by the host innate immune system [45].': 34, 'In the case of OSCC, it was demonstrated that P. gingivalis, but not F. nucleatum, promotes invasion and metastasis of oral squamous cells by inducing matrix metalloproteinase 9 (pro-MMP9) expression [44].': 31, 'Another study showed that prolonged and repetitive exposure to P. gingivalis increases aggressiveness of oral cancer cells via epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like changes in the cells [46].': 25, 'Therefore, oral pathogens, specifically P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, have been shown to positively correlate with development of oral cancer, suggesting that they could be biomarkers for early stages of the disease, or even targets for prevention of oral cancers in humans.': 42, 'Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, and has been associated with a high abundance of F.

nucleatum was found in higher numbers in human colonic adenomas relative to surrounding tissues and in stool samples from patients with CRC, compared with subjects without CRC [50].': 30, 'Additionally, in a mouse model of intestinal tumorigenesis, F. nucleatum increased tumor multiplicity and selectively recruited tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, which can promote tumor progression [50].': 25, 'Another mechanistic study showed that levels of F. nucleatum gradually increased during the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence in human fecal and mucosal samples [51].': 23, "F. nucleatum's ability to alter the composition of the lumen microbiota as well as its ability to mediate secretion of cytokines and activate tumorigenesis-related pathways was demonstrated in mouse models of CRC [51].": 33, 'In summary, these data indicate that F. nucleatum promotes a pro-inflammatory microenvironment that may contribute to neoplasia progression in colorectal

a diabetes model in rats [56].': 23, 'Interestingly, results from a meta-analysis study suggested that periodontal treatment leads to an improvement of glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients,

periodontitis, and conversely, periodontal inflammation negatively affects glycemic control.': 30, 'Additionally, periodontal treatment improves diabetes symptoms, confirming their association and the importance of oral health for the overall organism.': 19, "Alzheimer's disease\nAlzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive and irreversible impairment in memory, thinking, and language and learning capacity, which ultimately ends in death [62].": 30, 'The cognitive decline has been related to the formation of synaptotoxic β-amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the regions of the brain associated with advanced cognitive functions [62], [63].': 30, "As shown for diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease and periodontitis also present a bidirectional relationship that will be discussed in this section.": 21, 'A recent comprehensive oral-health study showed that individuals with brain injury had a higher prevalence of poor oral health parameters and chronic generalized periodontitis [64].': 25, "The brain, which was thought to have no or diminished immune responses because of its “immunologic privilege” status, can undergo different inflammatory processes that contribute to development of Alzheimer's disease, such as complement activation and cytokine and chemokine expression [65].": 40, "In fact, inflammation is viewed as the link between periodontitis and Alzheimer's disease.": 13, "The presence of activated glial cells that produce significant levels of inflammatory cytokines is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease [66].": 20, 'Besides the direct damage caused by β-amyloid plaques and tau aggregates, the innate immune response attempts to purge these aggregates from the brain, but instead aggravates neurodegeneration [62], [63].': 29, "Thus, an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines is detected in elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease and periodontitis [67].": 17, "Studies using different anti-inflammatory drugs and cytokines reinforce the hypothesis that inflammation is a major driver of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that nasal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) might be effective in slowing the onset of Alzheimer's disease [68].": 39, "In addition, the IL-1 receptor antagonist and immunosuppressive cytokines can protect the brain from further damage and decrease the rate of Alzheimer's disease progression [69].": 25, "The host synthesizes pro-inflammatory cytokines systemically in response to oral bacterial infection, suggesting that periodontal disease may contribute to the brain inflammation that characterizes Alzheimer's disease [65], [70].": 28, "Interestingly, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from periodontal pathogens such as P. gingivalis and T. denticola was isolated from short-term postmortem Alzheimer's disease human brains, suggesting that virulence factors from these pathogens could play a role in development of brain inflammation and Alzheimer's disease [71].": 42, "Moreover, bacteria such as the periodontal pathogen T. denticola [72] and C. pneumoniae [73], [74] were detected in postmortem Alzheimer's disease brains, suggesting that besides inflammatory mediators, some periodontal pathogens may invade the brain by crossing the brain-blood barrier.": 39, 'This was confirmed in animal studies, which showed the presence of P. gingivalis in mouse brains [75].': 17, "Moreover, higher levels of antibodies against A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, T. forsythia [70], F. nucleatum and P. intermedia [76] were observed in elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease, compared with healthy controls.": 31, "Although these periodontal pathogens seem to be associated with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, further longitudinal studies will be needed to directly link periodontal pathogens (and antibodies against them) with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.": 33, "In summary, poor oral hygiene contributes to chronic periodontitis and may indirectly increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease.": 18, "Conversely, patients with Alzheimer's disease present impairments in the ability to maintain proper oral hygiene or even visit a dentist for professional care, which enhances the risk for periodontitis.": 29, "In this sense, it is tempting to speculate that maintaining good oral health could become a prophylactic measure against Alzheimer's disease.": 21, 'Adverse pregnancy outcomes\nMaternal infections are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, pre-eclampsia, miscarriage, intra-uterine growth retardation, low birthweight, stillbirth, and neonatal sepsis [77].': 32, 'Due to hormonal changes in pregnant women, they are more susceptible to gingivitis and periodontitis than non-pregnant women [78].': 19, 'Indeed, approximately 40% of pregnant women demonstrate clinical evidence of periodontal disease [78].': 13, 'Two different mechanisms have been proposed to explain how oral health is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.': 17, 'The first proposes that oral pathogens themselves can translocate from an unhealthy oral cavity and cross the placenta, reaching the intra-amniotic fluid and fetal circulation [79].': 26, 'The second hypothesizes that the systemic dissemination of endotoxins or inflammatory mediators derived from periodontal disease could affect development of the fetus or spontaneous abortion [80].': 26, 'Bacterial pathogens, antigens, endotoxins, and pro-inflammatory cytokines produced during periodontal disease can cross the placental barrier, resulting in disturbances in the maternal-fetal unit that could contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes [81], [82].': 32, 'F. nucleatum is the most common oral pathogen found in a variety of placental and fetal tissues [77].': 18, "A case report of term stillbirth suggested that F. nucleatum could translocate from the mother's mouth to the uterus when her immune response was weakened during a respiratory infection [83].": 30, 'Consistent with its high invasiveness, F. nucleatum is repeatedly isolated from amniotic fluid and cord blood in cases of preterm birth and neonatal sepsis [84], [85].': 26, 'Furthermore, F. nucleatum is often detected along with other oral subspecies in intrauterine infections, which are likely from the same infectious origin, implying co-translocation from the oral cavity [77], [85].': 30, 'Other oral pathogens, such as P. gingivalis (and its endotoxins), were also found in the placenta of preterm delivery patients [86], [87].': 22, 'Studies in animal models demonstrate the ability of P. gingivalis to impact negatively on pregnancy: LPS from P. gingivalis induced placental and fetal growth restriction and resorption in rats [88]; and antibodies raised against P. gingivalis caused fetal loss when passively administered into mice [89].': 45, 'The maternal-fetal interface represents an immunologically unique site that must promote immune tolerance to the fetus while at the same time maintaining a robust host defense against possible infections.': 29, 'Even though little is known about the role of innate immune receptors during pregnancy, it was known that the placenta expresses Toll-like receptors (TLRs) during normal pregnancy [90].': 28, 'Periodontal disease or the presence of periodontal pathogens such as T. denticola and P. gingivalis have been shown to increase the expression of TLRs [82], [91], suggesting increased innate immune responses.': 31, 'Although more studies will be required to establish conclusively that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between periodontal disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes, the results so far suggest that preventive measures against periodontal disease in pregnant women are warranted.': 38, 'The oral cavity as a diagnostic tool\nThe realization that oral health is linked to systemic disease and can affect the progression or development of diverse diseases has led to the search for biomarkers in the oral cavity that could detect systemic disease.': 43, 'The oral cavity is easily accessible, allowing for non-invasive tests in most cases; and patients usually visit dentists more often than general practitioners.': 23, 'Thus, use of the oral cavity for early diagnosis of systemic disease should increase the likelihood of successful treatment of many non-oral diseases.': 23, 'The saliva is becoming an attractive diagnostic tool for systemic disease, including cancer, bowel disease, diabetes, neurodegenerative disease, and muscle and joint disease [92], [93] since the collection of saliva is quick, simple, and non-invasive [94].': 36, 'The analysis of multiple biomarkers in saliva could help to detect the presence of several diseases simultaneously, and electrochemical sensor systems could quickly detect salivary protein and genetic markers for diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity, allowing health care providers to screen for systemic diseases easily and quickly [95].': 49, 'Current progress has been made with the development of “omics”-based markers for some diseases, such as OSCC [94].': 18, 'Microbiomics, methylomics, and metabolomics, among other high-throughput approaches, have shown promising potential for detection of some diseases, but further research is needed in many cases to confirm the specific type of disease [96], [97], [98], [99].': 36, 'Although this field is in its infancy, we are confident that dental practitioners will soon be diagnosing many non-oral systemic diseases in their clinic.': 24, 'Concluding remarks\nA growing body of evidence in the literature shows the direct and indirect impact of periodontal pathogens on overall health.': 22, 'Recent epidemiological, clinical and experimental studies support the relationship between bacteremia or inflammation due to periodontal disease and systemic disease.': 20, 'More studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms whereby periodontal pathogens or the ensuing inflammation cause or contribute to systemic disease.': 21, 'Nonetheless, it is already clear that management of periodontal disease and proper oral care can positively impact the morbidity, mortality, and health care costs associated with non-oral systemic diseases.': 29, 'Abstract\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major public health concern currently.': 12, 'To date, there are no approved antiviral drugs or vaccines against this transmissible disease.': 14, 'This report sheds light on available information for a better understanding of clinical trials and pharmacotherapy related to COVID-19.': 19,

A later onset is not uncommon, especially following a secondary hypoxic insult such as pneumothorax.': 32, 'Catastrophic deterioration evolves in minutes to hours.': 7, 'Aggressive neurosurgical intervention is rarely considered as many of these infants do not survive this event.': 16, 'The saltatory or subacute presentation is seen principally in an infant with a smaller hemorrhage that evolves over hour to days.': 21, 'There may be a subtle change in the decreased alertness and activity, hypotonia, abnormally tight popliteal angle, abnormal eye movements, and respiratory difficulties.': 23, 'Many IVHs are clinically silent and is one diagnosed by cranial ultrasonography.': 12, 'An unexplained decline in the hematocrit, decreased tone and activity may suggest that an IVH has occurred [4].': 18, 'Management of IVH\nThe incidence of IVH in premature infants who weigh less than 1500 g decreased from 35%–70% to 15%–20% in the past three decades [5,6].': 27, 'Less than half of these children will develop transient or progressive ventriculomegaly.': 12, 'Considerable ventriculomegaly can occur before any increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) or head circumference

neurosurgeon as early as possible when premature IVH with more than a subependymal hemorrhage or mild progression of ventricular dilatation is diagnosed.': 28, 'Pharmacological treatment\nIn the acute hemorrhage maintaining cerebral perfusion and ICP may be undertaken medically by decreasing the PaCO2, and perhaps using some medicine.': 24, 'However, a large multicenter randomized trial showed that

reducing pressure, free iron, and proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines may reduce death and severe disability, prevention of PHH in newborn infants by DRIFT has been conducted in UK since 2003.': 41, 'A total of 77 premature babies with IVH were studied.': 10, 'Though DRIFT improves cognitive function in the 52 out of the 66 surviving babies after 10-year follow-up, secondary IVH is a major complication that up to 35% of the infants who received DRIFT had secondary IVH compared with 8% of the standard group.': 43, 'In addition, DRIFT did not reduce shunt surgery or death when tested in a

measures are always instituted until the infant is mature enough at age and/or weight.': 36, 'Many different approaches have been taken to achieve temporary ventricular decompression in infants with PHH [11].': 16, 'Therapeutic serial lumbar and ventricular tapping remain temporizing options in the treatment of PHH used by 10% and 30% of the neonatal units.': 23, 'Serial lumbar punctures\nLumbar puncture (LP) is only useful when the ventricles are in communication with the lumbar subarachnoid space [3].': 21, 'Daily LPs can be used if it is necessary to stabilize the head circumference, and usually up to 10 ml of CSF is removed per LP [4].': 27, 'It is often difficult to remove sufficient quantities of CSF in these infants, and, again, the child is exposed to contamination each time.': 23, 'Spinal osteomyelitis has been associated with repeated LPs [12].': 9, 'It has been suggested that daily LPs need to occur for at least 7 days to be effective whereas the repeated procedures can be traumatic for the premature infants and, therefore, not always the preferred treatment.': 36, 'Randomized controlled trials have failed to demonstrate a significant effect of serial LPs on the rates of morbidity, mortality or conversion to permanent VP shunt in the treatment of PHH [[13], [14], [15], [16]].': 34, 'Lumbar tappings are also associated with increased risk of CSF infection [17].': 12, 'Hence, early repeated LPs cannot be recommended as the mainstay treatment for neonates at risk of, or actually developing PHH and spinal taps are increasingly considered a temporizing measure in the management of PPH only for an initial period.': 39, 'If frequent multiple LPs are needed other measures can be used as described below [18].': 15, 'Serial ventricular punctures\nRepeated ventricular taps incur a new injury to the frontal lobe with each pass of a needle (“puncture porencephaly”).': 22, 'Each access exposes the child to the risk of infection.': 10,

culture-positivity would provide a rationale for proposing strategies of isolation of infected patients.': 19, 'Serological antibody tests\nSerological antibody detection is the other broad category of tests to diagnose COVID-19, and this method detects IgM, IgG, or total antibodies (typically in the blood) against SARS-CoV-2.': 31, 'Techniques used for antibody detection include virus neutralization assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunochromatographic assay, chemiluminescent immunoassay, etc.': 18, '[11,[14], [15], [16], [17]].': 4, 'Most tests are designed to capture antibodies, which recognize the nucleocapsid (N) protein and the S1 subunit and receptor biding domain (RBD) of Spike (S) proteins, as N and S proteins are the two major coronavirus immunogens [15,16].': 38, 'RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies derived from two B cell clones of one COVID-19 patient have demonstrated impressive binding and neutralizing activity against live SARS-CoV-2 [18].': 24, 'Of importance, these serologic tests should not cross-react with other seasonal coronaviruses.': 12, 'Nevertheless, the use of antibody tests is limited to settings of acute illness because it takes time for hosts to mount an adequate immune response [3].': 26, 'Studies indicate that the majority of patients have seroconversion 2 weeks after symptom onset [11,16,19].': 15, 'Less than 40% of patients had detectable antibodies within 1 week of onset, but this percentage rapidly increased to 94.3% (IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) 15 days after onset, with the median seroconversion time of 12 and 14 days, respectively [16].': 40, 'IgM began to decline 4 weeks after symptom onset, while IgG remained at high levels after 7 weeks [17,19].': 19, 'Based on the time course of seroconversion, serological tests could be used as complementary tools to identify patients presenting late in their illness [16].': 24, 'As mentioned earlier, seroconversion has not usually been followed by a rapid decline in viral RNA load [11].': 18, 'Serological tests may also aid in (i) contact tracing, (ii) assessment of prior infection and immunity to SARS–CoV-2 (if there is protective immunity), (iii) determining the extent of the pandemic with seroprevalence data, and (iv) vaccine evaluation studies [3,6].': 39, 'To date, it is not known whether antibodies elicited by SARS–CoV-2 provide protective immunity against reinfection and how long the protective immunity lasts.': 23, 'A rhesus macaque study does suggest protective immunity after recovery from primary infection, since reinfection did not occur in convalescent monkeys rechallenged with the same dose of SARS-CoV-2 strains [20].': 30, 'Further studies are necessary to elucidate the situation in humans.': 10, 'Rapid antigen-detection methods using immunoassays targeted at N or S proteins are under development, although with the same challenge of low sensitivity observed in influenza virus antigen tests.': 28, 'To date, a number of laboratory-developed assays and commercially available kits (mostly NAATs and serological antibody tests) have been granted an EUA by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which greatly

in the favipiravir arm (91.43% versus 62%) [40].': 33, 'Another multicentered randomized clinical study also suggested that the 7 day clinical recovery rate increased in the favipiravir treatment group, along with shorter defervescence time and cough in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes [41].': 34, 'Although few adverse effects were reported during treatment, potential drug and drug interactions should be kept in mind because favipiravir undergoes metabolism in the liver by aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase to produce an inactive oxidative metabolite and is excreted by the

'SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies\nThe humoral immune response mediated by antibodies is crucial for preventing viral infections.': 16, 'Therefore, the development of specific surface epitope-targeting neutralizing antibodies is a more long-term, albeit more specific, approach to target COVID-19 [43].': 21, 'SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAb) have been detected in patients from day 10–15 after the onset of the disease and remained thereafter.': 21, 'The titers of NAb among these patients correlated with the spike-binding antibodies targeting the S1, RBD, and S2 regions.': 19, 'Studies in China indicated that one or two doses of 200 mL of convalescent plasma derived from recently recovered donors with neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 were well tolerated and could significantly increase or maintain the neutralizing antibodies at a high level; this outcome leads to disappearance of viremia, improvement of clinical symptoms, and absorption of lung lesions in radiological examination when administered, in addition to supportive care and antiviral agents such as lopinavir/ritonavir and favipiravir.': 76, 'The donors must be symptom-free for at least 14 days, have a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test after recovery to provide ABO-compatible and test negative plasma for major blood-borne diseases at the time of blood donation.': 35, 'Known general reactions such as transfusion-associated circulatory overload and transfusion-associated acute lung injury in patients with already severe lung damage still exist and need to be closely monitored [[47], [44], [45], [46]].': 32, 'Blocking the interleukin (IL)-6 pathway\nEvidence suggests that cytokine release syndrome (CRS) might play a major role in severe COVID-19 [23,48].': 21, 'Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-1β, induced protein 10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, are significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients, especially in severe patients with life-threatening multiple organ dysfunction.': 29, 'In COVID-19 patients with elevated inflammatory cytokines, postmortem pathology has revealed tissue necrosis and interstitial macrophage and

soluble and membrane-bound IL-6R to inhibit IL-6-mediated cis- and trans-signaling [51].': 14, 'Given the efficacy of tocilizumab in CRS and the pivotal role of IL-6 in COVID-19, clinical use should consider evaluation of patients with the following criteria: (i) H score, a diagnostic score for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), to discriminate patients with CRS; (ii) Chinese guidelines for COVID-19 grade patients into mild, moderate, severe, and critical by vital signs, radiographic findings, and complications; (iii) IL-6 measurement, as IL-6 levels are significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients, especially in ICU patients [52].': 78, 'CRP, an acute-phase inflammatory protein synthesized by IL-6-dependent hepatic biosynthesis, is a reliable marker of IL-6 bioactivity and is used to predict CRS severity and monitor IL-6 blockade efficacy [53].': 30, 'Most studies suggested that elevated CRP levels are associated with severe COVID-19 [52].': 13, 'Clinicians should add antivirals and cautiously evaluate the possibility of secondary infection thereafter [54].': 14, 'Adverse hepatic effects have been reported previously, and clinicians should consider discontinuation of drug in cases of marked elevation of liver enzymes and hyperbilirubinemia.': 24, 'Other drug–drug interactions should be monitored because tocilizumab interferes with the serum concentration of

of a lipid bilayer and envelope proteins.': 14, 'SARS-CoV-2 initiates human cell entry after the S protein present on the envelope binds to a cell membrane receptor called ACE2.': 21, 'The S protein is cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2, by a human cell-derived protease, which is thought to be furin.': 22, 'S1 then binds to its receptor, ACE2.': 7, 'The other fragment, S2, is cleaved by TMPRSS2, a human cell surface serine protease, resulting in membrane fusion.': 18, 'Both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are therefore thought to be essential in airway cells for SARS-CoV-2 infection.': 16, 'An in

targeting epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract and gut, two main sites that express high levels of the ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2, makes Ad5 an advantageous viral vector against COVID-19.': 38, 'Recombinant Ad5 vector-based vaccines have been examined in clinical trials against infectious diseases [71,72].': 14, 'The work for COVID-19 has been accelerated based on the experiences of previous trials.': 14, 'A candidate vaccine known as Ad5-nCoV, which encodes a full-length S protein of SARS-CoV-2, is the first demonstrated to be safe for humans and to proceed to a Phase II clinical trial in China.': 34, 'Another viral vector vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, is composed of a nonreplicating chimpanzee adenovirus vector and genetic sequence of S protein.': 20, 'The vector represents an attractive alternative to the human adenoviral vector due to its good safety profile and lack of pre-existing immunity in human population [73].': 26, 'The vaccine candidate has entered a Phase II/III clinical trial.': 10, 'Lentivirus vector (LV) systems represent an attractive technology for vaccine development.': 11, 'In addition to their ability to effectively deliver genes or antigens of interest into cells and to generate humoral and cellular mediated immune response against the encoded transgenes [74], LVs can transduce antigen presenting cells (APCs), the main cell types mediating the immune response, at high efficiencies with little to no cytotoxicity [75].': 53, 'Through up or downregulation of immune modulatory genes in APCs by LVs, the genetically modified APCs may potentially activate a strong protective immunity against infections [75].': 26, 'Two vaccine candidates, Covid-19/aAPC vaccine and LV-SMENP-DC vaccine, which were made by modifying artificial APCs and dendritic cells with LVs expressing multiple viral genes and immune modulatory genes, act as ‘Trojan horses’ against SARS-CoV-2 virus.': 35, 'Clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate their safety and immune reactivity.': 12, 'Bifidobacterium is one of the domestic, nonpathogenic anaerobic bacteria found in the intestine of humans.': 15, 'These organisms are believed to have health-promoting properties for their host, including increasing the immune response and protecting the host against viral infection [76].': 24, 'As vaccine vectors, they offer several advantages including low cost, low resistance to antibiotics, noninvasive administration, and high safety levels.': 20, 'The most attractive feature is that bifidobacterium tends to elicit high levels of mucosal antibodies against the expressed foreign antigen following uptake via the mucosal immune system [77].': 28, 'Some strains of bifidobacterium have been used as a delivery vector for the development of vaccines against Hepatitis C virus and enterovirus 71 [78,79].': 24, 'The bacTRL-Spike vaccine candidate contains live Bifidobacterium longum, which contains synthetic plasmid DNA encoding the S protein of SARS-CoV-2.': 19, 'The ongoing trial is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of orally delivered bacTRL-Spike vaccine in healthy adults.': 19, 'Antibody-dependent enhancement\nAntibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a condition in which subneutralizing or nonneutralizing antibodies are produced following primary infection or vaccination, and they enhance the infectivity of subsequent infections [80].': 30, 'ADE modulates the immune response and elicits sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm [81].': 14, 'ADE has been observed for a variety of viruses, most notably flaviviruses (e.g., DNEV) [82].': 15, 'ADE also occurs in SARS-CoV infection [83,84].': 7, 'Diluted anti-sera against SARS-CoV promotes SARS-CoV infection, and this enhancement is significantly mediated by anti-S protein antibodies [83,84].': 18, 'Similarly, vaccination with recombinant S protein of SARS-CoV elicits both neutralizing and ADE-inducing IgG antibodies [85].': 16, 'As described above, many potential vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 have focused on the full-length S protein.': 16, 'Attributed to the taxonomic and structural similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, ADE is a critical issue that should be considered seriously during the practical application of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.': 28, 'Three approaches have been suggested to mitigate the adverse effects of ADE.': 12, 'The first one is shielding the nonneutralizing epitopes of the S proteins by glycosylation.': 14, 'The second approach is immunofocusing, which aims to direct the adaptive immune responses to target only the critical neutralizing epitope to elicit a more robust protective immunity.': 27, 'Supporting evidence for the latter is that a vaccine candidate based on the shorter RBD induced higher neutralizing activity than based the full-length S protein [10,86].': 26, 'The third approach is eliminating epitope sequences that mediate enhancement of infection.': 12, 'Protein sequences responsible for ADE have been identified at S597−603 of the SARS-CoV S protein [85], a region that is also conserved in SARS-CoV-2 [40].': 25, 'Thus, vaccines against COVID-19 could be engineered to minimize ADE via elimination of the epitope.': 15, 'BCG vaccination\nBacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), the most commonly administered vaccine worldwide, contains a live attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis to protect against tuberculosis (TB).': 24, 'Universal vaccination at birth with a single dose of BCG is recommended in many countries where TB is highly endemic or where there is high risk of exposure to TB, such as Japan, China, and Taiwan.': 36, 'Other countries, such as Spain, France, and Switzerland, have discontinued their universal vaccine policies because of the declining incidence of TB infection and the proven variable effectiveness in preventing adult TB.': 31, 'Countries such as the United States, Italy, and the Netherlands have yet to adopt universal vaccine policies [87].': 18, 'Although developed to prevent severe forms of tuberculosis in children, BCG vaccination has been shown to induce heterologous or nonspecific immune effects against nonmycobacterial pathogens, a phenomenon termed ‘trained immunity’.': 30, 'Trained immunity refers to the ability of innate immune memory to mount an enhanced subsequent response to diverse microbes [88].': 20, 'Favorable effects of BCG have been observed in mouse and human studies for distinct viral pathogens [89,90].': 17, 'Epidemiological studies have also linked BCG vaccination to the reduction in all-cause mortality in neonates and respiratory infections in elderly [91,92].': 21, 'NOD2-and mTOR-mediated changes in the epigenetic landscape of immune cells is proposed to underly such protection to increase the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β, and enhance anti-viral immunity [88,93].': 30, 'Recent preprint studies suggested significant associations of BCG vaccination with prevalence, progression of disease, and mortality due to COVID-19 [94,95].': 20, 'The authors indicated that countries without universal policies for BCG vaccination have been more severely affected compared to countries with routine use of the vaccine in neonates.': 27, 'The National Immunization Program in Taiwan has included neonatal BCG vaccination since 1965, and the coverage rate has remained at 97% since 2001 [96].': 24, 'As of May 20, 2020, a cumulative total of 440 COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Taiwan with a case fatality rate was of 1.6%.': 24, "The low morbidity and mortality rate are attributed to the government's quick response, border control, case identification, containment, and resource allocation to protect public health [97].": 26, 'It is not known whether BCG vaccination plays a protective role against COVID-19 infection in Taiwan.': 16, 'In addition to BCG, live attenuated influenza vaccine has been shown to promote NK cell-mediated heterologous immunity [98].': 18, 'Previous studies also suggest that the heterologous beneficial effects of BCG vaccination may vary by BCG formulation, age, and route of administration [91,99].': 23, 'Although these vaccines may bridge the gap until a vaccine specifically for SARS-CoV-2 is available, their protective effects and clinical relevance need to be further characterized.': 26, 'Clinical trials have been initiated to study the effects of BCG vaccination given to healthcare workers who are at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic [Table 2].': 27, 'Before the evidence is available, the WHO is not likely to recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19 [100].': 20, 'Conclusions\nIn the face of a pandemic, the rapid development, production, and deployment of diagnostic tools, drugs and vaccines are critical.': 21, 'Scientific advancements since the SARS and MERS pandemics have accelerated our understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the development of therapies to treat viral infection.': 31, 'Rigorous and adequate clinical trials for drug safety and effectiveness in randomized, controlled trials remain fundamental measures to protect the public from drugs that are ineffective, unsafe, or both.': 29, 'Some available candidate drugs targeting different levels of human responses to COVID-19, such as cell membrane fusion, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, viral protease inhibitor, IL-6 blocker and convalescent plasma, may improve the clinical outcomes of critical COVID-19 patients.': 37, 'As no effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2 is currently available, the best action is to develop vaccines to prevent the infection.': 20, 'Some potential vaccine candidates have progressed to Phase I and II clinical trials, but a year and a half are likely to pass before an effective vaccine is vetted through trials and is ready for marketing for humans.': 38, 'Therefore, considerable efforts should be given to limit or hinder the spread of the virus.': 15, 'In addition, pandemics will generate simultaneous demand for drugs and vaccines around the world.': 14, 'The elderly and those with underlying diseases or chronic comorbidities are at greater risk of severe disease or mortality.': 19, 'Clinical and serologic studies will be needed to confirm which populations remain at the highest risk once effective treatments or vaccines are available.': 23, 'Strong international coordination and collaboration among studies, pharmaceutical companies, regulators, and governments are needed to ensure that promising therapies or vaccines can be manufactured and supplied successfully.': 27, 'The first wave of this pandemic has created devastating social, economic, and political threats.': 14, 'It is time for us to work together, share experiences, and move forward to fight COVID-19.': 16, 'Although this virus persists, there is light at the end of the tunnel.': 13, 'Abstract\nThe novel human coronavirus disease COVID-19 has become the fifth documented pandemic since the 1918 flu pandemic.': 18, 'COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and subsequently spread worldwide.': 11, 'The coronavirus was officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses based on phylogenetic analysis.': 24, 'SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be a spillover of an animal coronavirus and later adapted the ability of human-to-human transmission.': 19,

'Initially, the disease was called Wuhan pneumonia by the press because of the area and pneumonia symptoms.': 17, 'Whole-genome sequencing results showed that the causative agent is a novel coronavirus.': 12, 'Therefore, this virus is the seventh member of the coronavirus family to infect humans [3].': 15, 'The World Health Organization (WHO) temporarily termed the new virus 2019 novel

animal origins, namely, natural hosts.': 17, 'Bats may be the natural hosts of HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and MERS-CoV.': 12, 'Furthermore, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 probably originated from rodents

intermediate hosts that cause virus transmission from natural hosts to humans; for example, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV crossed the species barriers into masked palm civets and camels, respectively [30,31] [Table 1].': 37, 'SARS-CoV-2 sequenced at the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak only shares 79.6% sequence identity with SARS-CoV through early full-length genomic comparisons.': 22, 'However, it is highly identical (96.2%) at the whole-genome level to Bat-CoV RaTG13, which was previously detected in Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan Province, over 1500 km from Wuhan [21].': 29, 'Bats are likely

intermediate host sample was obtained by scientists in an initial cluster of infections of the Huanan Seafood and Wildlife Market in Wuhan, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of zoonotic infection.': 36, 'Furthermore, the earliest three patients with symptom onset had no known history of exposure to the Huanan market [1].': 19, 'Therefore, there may be multiple sources of COVID-19 in the beginning.': 11, 'According to previous studies by metagenomic sequencing for the samples from Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) in Guangxi and Guangdong, China, it has been suggested that pangolins might be the intermediate hosts between bats and humans because of the similarity of the pangolin coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2 [32,33].': 46, 'However, the additional phylogenetic analyses effectively trace COVID-19 infection sources.': 10, 'In addition to the zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2 by natural evolution, there are still some disputes about the origin of the virus because its spike protein seems to perfectly interact with the human receptor in contributing to human-to-human transmission after evolution in a short period.': 45, 'Nevertheless, more direct evidence is required to clarify the arguments.': 10, 'Evolution of SARS-COV-2 during the past few months\nReplication of RNA viruses could generate mutations due to the low proofreading ability of their RdRP.':

the construction of a phylogenetic network is crucial to investigate the adaption of the virus in different human populations and environments.': 27, 'Although the virus keeps evolving within humans who could also be susceptible to other human coronaviruses, recombination between SARS-CoV-2 and old human coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, has not been found.': 34, 'Nevertheless, a recent study claimed that three genetic types of the virus have been circulating globally [37].': 17, 'The study demonstrated that the genotypes could also correlate to the geographic locations, while the sample size and analysis methods in the study are still being argued in the research field [38].': 32, 'Therefore, it is still unclear whether the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 could be affected by replication environments, such as genetic and immunological restrictions in different human populations.': 26, 'With evolutionary pressure, the selection of SARS-CoV-2 mutations will be ongoing.': 11, 'The investigation of the geographic patterns of SARS-CoV-2 variations will provide information on vaccine development for different populations.': 18, 'Conclusions\nHuman coronaviruses usually cause mild upper respiratory diseases.': 9, 'However, in the past two decades, two coronaviruses transmitted from animals, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have caused severe pneumonia and death in humans.': 22, 'In addition, since late December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally and consequently resulted in at least 772,296 deaths worldwide as of August 18, 2020 [39].': 27, 'Due to the high sequence homology with a coronavirus isolated from bats, SARS-CoV-2 is considered a zoonotic origin coronavirus.': 19, 'Undoubtedly, SARS-CoV-2 has become the fifth human coronavirus, and it

intracellular replication.': 22, 'Bacterial factors in H. pylori pathogenesis\nStep 1: Urease and survival under acidic stomach conditions\nH. pylori has developed an acid acclimation mechanism that promotes adjustment of periplasmic pH in the harsh acidic environment of the stomach by regulating urease activity.': 41, 'The urease gene cluster is composed of seven genes, including catalytic subunits (ureA/B), an acid-gated urea channel (ureI), and accessory assembly proteins (ureE-H) [2].': 24, 'The metal cofactor nickel has to be inserted into the apoenzyme for heterodimer urease activity through the action of the four accessory proteins, among which UreE appears to be an important metallochaperone [3].': 33, 'A recent paper describes how the other metallochaperone, HypA, interacts with UreE, and facilitates nickel transfer from HypA to UreE, and subsequently to downstream partner proteins, possibly UreG [3].': 29, 'However, the mechanism of nickel transfer and insertion into the apo-urease is currently not well understood and requires further studies.': 20, 'Intrabacterial urease activity is required for acid resistance by H. pylori, and this activity is regulated by the proton-gated urea channel UreI, which permits urea entry only under acidic conditions to prevent lethal alkalization during times of relative neutrality.': 39, 'UreI channels present in the inner membrane are closed at pH 7.0 and fully open at pH 5.0, enabling the rapid entry of urea into the bacterium [4].': 28, 'As a consequence, H. pylori produces unusually large amounts of urea-derived ammonium.': 12, 'Surprisingly, UreI may be capable of extruding NH3 and/or NH4 across the inner membrane, allowing rapid neutralization of protons entering the periplasm [5].': 23, 'Moreover, Miller and Maier indicated urea-derived ammonium is possibly assimilated into amino acids, thus connecting acid resistance and nitrogen metabolism [6].': 21, 'Urease is also found on the H. pylori surface due to the lysis of some organisms.': 16, 'Extracellular urease is supposed to break down urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia, and ammonium hydroxide will be produced quickly when ammonia combines with water.': 25, 'Therefore, H. pylori can safely pass through the gastric juice when ammonia hydroxide neutralizes the acidic micro-environment close to the bacteria [4], [6].': 23, 'Schwartz and Allen indicated that, in addition to the role of urease in colonization, urease regulates H. pylori-macrophage interactions [7].': 20, 'Although phagocytosis is an element of the innate immune response, important for killing invading microbes, urease can modulate phagosome pH and megasome formation and as such, is essential for H. pylori survival in macrophages [7].': 35, 'To allow the rapid adjustment of periplasmic pH, the ArsRS two-component system, in an acid-responsive manner, controls the transcription of the urease gene cluster [8].': 25, 'Recently, a second, cytoplasmically localized acid responsive sensor kinase, FlgS, was identified in H. pylori.': 15, 'Although FlgS, with its cognate response regulator, HP0703, is known to regulate flagellar gene transcription, Marcus et al.': 18, 'indicated that a decrease in the cytoplasmic pH, exaggerated in the absence of membrane-located ArsS, may activate cytoplasmic FlgS [9].': 20, 'However, the regulatory network between the two histidine sensor kinases is still unclear.': 13, 'Treatment of H. pylori infection is becoming less effective as a result of increasing antibiotic resistance worldwide, suggesting that an alternatively targeted approach to eradicate H. pylori would be beneficial.': 30, 'Previous studies showed that a urease-negative mutant is unable to colonize gastric epithelium cells for persistent infection in gnotobiotic piglets [10], [11].': 22, 'Interestingly, the addition of a nickel-free diet to standard triple therapy significantly increases the H. pylori eradication rate, supposedly due to the reduction of H. pylori urease activity [12].': 29, 'As a result, the inhibition of urease activity would compromise the ability to colonize the stomach and therefore provide a target for the prevention or eradication of H. pylori infection.': 30, 'Recently, the UreI channel structure has been resolved, and it may guide the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors, providing the possibility of monotherapy without the use of conventional antibiotics [13].': 29, 'Step 2: Flagella and movement toward epithelium cells\nH. pylori moves through the gastric mucosa epithelium layer to the basal layer where the pH value is close to 7.0 by the action of 4–7 polar sheathed flagella.': 37, 'Previous studies showed that flagella-mediated motility is essential for the H. pylori colonization of the gnotobiotic piglet and mouse gastric mucosa [14], [15].': 23, 'Mutagenesis of just about any gene of the motility and chemotaxis systems abolishes the ability of H. pylori to infect the stomach and establish colonization [14], [15], [16].': 28, 'showed that patients infected with higher motility H. pylori may show enhanced bacterial density, triggering a higher inflammatory response in the upper stomach, and thus being associated with severe pathological outcomes [17].': 32, 'In these respects, flagella can be considered as an early stage colonization/virulence factor.': 13, 'Moreover, mice immunized with a vaccine enriched for H. pylori flagella sheath proteins exhibited significantly reduced colonization, equivalent to that observed in mice immunized with whole-cell lysate.': 27, 'Due to the high antigenicity of flagella related proteins, flagella can be considered a suitable diagnostic and vaccine target [18], [19].': 21, 'H. pylori flagella are mainly composed of the basal body, hook, and flagellar filament [20].': 15, 'The flagellar filament is consisted of two flagellins (FlaA and FlaB) encoded by flaA and flaB [20].': 17, 'The hook is composed of FlgE, and it links the basal body and flagellar filament [20].': 16, 'The basal body is composed of several protein structures, and it plays a role in providing the energy source for motility.': 21, 'In a previous study, flaA and flaB have been indicated as necessary genes for the complete motility of H. pylori [21].': 21, 'Moreover, the serological response to FlaA can be used as a marker to show the presence of H. pylori infection.': 20, 'The titer of anti-FlaA antibody is increased with the increment of colonization density of H. pylori, and serves as a noninvasive biomarker for early detection of gastric cancer [22].': 29, 'However, a single predicted biomarker for screening gastric cancer always results in a relatively lower positive predictive value.': 18, 'Therefore, serum FlaA antibody should be used in combination with other markers to screen for gastric cancer.': 17, 'More than 40 proteins are involved in the biosynthesis and operation of flagella, making motility one of the most complex processes in the bacterial cell [20].': 26, 'Flagellar related genes are divided into three classes, governed by the housekeeping sigma factor σ80 (RpoD, regulating class 1 genes), the alternative sigma factors σ54 (RpoN, regulating class 2 genes), and σ28 (FliA, regulating class 3 genes) [Fig.': 38, '2] [23].': 2, 'Class 1 flagellar genes comprise the major regulatory genes (rpoN, flgR, flgS, and flhA) and structural genes (motA and motB) of the flagellar system [23].': 25, 'Transcription of the class 2 middle flagellar genes (flaB, flgE, flgK, flgM, and flgL) and the sigma factor σ28 are governed by RpoN, assisted by the histidine kinase FlgS and the response regulator FlgR [23].': 35, 'Late structural genes, including flaA, belong to the class 3 flagellar genes, regulated by σ28 [23].': 16, 'In addition, FlhA is necessary for full transcription of flagellar class 2 and 3 genes [23].': 16, 'Surprisingly, no flagellar master regulator similar to FlhDC in the Enterobacteriaceae has been found in the H. pylori genome.': 19, 'Recently, Kao et al.': 4, 'showed CsrA, a RNA binding protein, controls H. pylori J99 motility by regulating RpoN expression and flagella formation [24].': 19, 'However, despite intensive research about the roles of motility in H. pylori pathogenesis, the complex transcriptional network that controls the expression of flagellar genes in H. pylori is still incompletely understood.': 31, 'Current model of the flagellar transcriptional regulatory cascade for Helicobacter pylori flagellar biosynthesis.': 13, 'These genes are color-coded on the basis of their classification in the transcriptional regulatory cascade: black (class 1 genes), gray (class 2 genes), and purple (class 3 genes).': 28, 'Class 1 flagellar genes comprise most of the major regulatory genes of the flagellar system, including σ54 (RpoN), and FlgR.': 20, 'Formation of the flagellar T3SS has been proposed to create a signal detected by the FlgS sensor kinase, resulting in autophosphorylation of the protein.': 24, 'Phosphotransfer to the FlgR response regulator activates the protein, allowing for interactions with and stimulation of σ54.': 17, 'The expression of σ54 is positively regulated by CsrA through unclear mechanism.': 12, 'Alternative sigma factor σ28 (FliA) and structural proteins, including the minor flagellin FlaB, belong to Class 2 flagellar genes and are under the control of σ54.': 26, 'The T3SS facilitates the ordered secretion of the class 2 rod, ring, and hook proteins.': 15, 'The class 3 genes include flaA, which encodes the major flagellin, and those for other minor filament proteins, under the control of σ28.': 23, 'Recently, H. pylori flagellin was found to be heavily glycosylated with the novel sialic acid-like nonulosonate, pseudaminic acid (Pse).': 19, 'The glycosylation process is essential for assembly of functional flagellar filaments and consequent bacterial motility [25].': 16, 'Therefore, the Pse biosynthetic pathway offers considerable potential as an antivirulence drug target, especially since motility is required for H. pylori colonization and persistence in the host.': 27, 'Small-molecule inhibitors of the Pse biosynthetic pathway that penetrate the H. pylori cell membrane and prevent the formation of flagella were identified, however, the binding modes and in vivo inhibition activity are still unclear [26].': 35, 'Moreover, the role of flagella posttranslational modification in immune recognition clearly needs further investigation.': 14, 'In addition to motility, the role of flagella in bacterial adherence to mammalian hosts has been demonstrated for various bacterial species in a number of hosts.': 26, 'For example, polar flagella glycosylation is extremely important for Aeromonas hydrophila adhesion to Hep-2 cells, biofilm formation, and immune stimulation of interleukin-8 (IL-8) production via toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) [27].': 30, 'In animal cell models, Pseudomonas aeruginosa flagella can recognize lung epithelial cells through heparan sulfate, a highly sulfated proteoglycan [28].': 20, 'However, there is no evidence of specific attachment of H. pylori flagella to epithelial cells, and the role of flagella in cell adhesion is controversial.': 25, 'Clyne et al.': 3, 'have studied whether H. pylori flagella are directly involved in adhesion by constructing flagellin (flaA and/or flaB) mutants and a flagellar regulator (flbA) mutant, and it appeared that all mutants adhered to gastric cells, indicating that flagella do not play a direct role in adhesion of H. pylori [29].': 49, 'Although a lower adhesion rate in a flbA mutant was observed, the authors suggested that in addition to regulating flagella, FlbA may regulate some H. pylori adhesins [29].': 28, 'revealed flagella associated regulator (csrA or rpoN) mutants showed decreased bacterial adhesion to AGS cells [24].': 16, 'Taken together, although flagella may not directly participate in cell adhesion, regulators controlling flagellar-related genes are thought to affect adhesin expression.': 21, 'Therefore, the complex flagella formation process and its role in H. pylori pathogenesis needs further investigation.': 16, 'Step 3: Adhesins and attachment to cellular surface receptors\nAdhesins\nWhen H. pylori colonizes on the mucosal layer lining the gastric epithelium, the interaction of bacterial adhesins with cellular receptors protects the bacteria from displacement from the stomach by forces such as those generated by peristalsis and gastric emptying, and then bacteria get metabolic substrates and nutrients to improve growth through releasing toxins to damage the host cells.': 68, 'Although blood-antigen binding protein A (BabA) and sialic acid-binding adhesin (SabA) are the well-characterized adhesins studied so far, not all H. pylori strains express these adhesins [30], [31].': 28, 'There are several other known adhesins in H. pylori for adapting to different hosts/tissues, including neutrophil-activating protein (NAP) [32], heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) [33], adherence-associated proteins (AlpA and AlpB) [34], H. pylori outer membrane protein (HopZ) [35], and lacdiNAc-binding adhesin (LabA) [36].': 43, 'Neutrophil activating protein A\nH. pylori-NAP belongs to the DNA-protecting proteins under starved conditions (Dps) family, which has significant structural similarities to the dodecameric ferritin family.': 26, 'NAP was first identified to stimulate high production of oxygen radicals from neutrophils, leading to damage of local tissues, and promote neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells during H. pylori infection [37].': 31, 'This NAP-induced adhesion depends on the acquisition of a high-affinity state of β2 integrin on the neutrophil surface membrane [38].': 20, 'In addition to the stimulation of reactive oxygen species production, NAP induces the expression and release of IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, and MIP-1β by neutrophils [38].': 27, 'As a result, NAP is highly associated with the hallmark of chronic gastritis, and infiltration of neutrophils and mononuclear cells into the gastric mucosa, caused by H. pylori infection.': 29, 'The glycosphingolipids expressed on the neutrophil surface serve as a major receptor to interact with the NAP expressed on bacterial surface [38].': 22, 'Moreover, NAP is supposed to facilitate SabA-mediated binding of sialylated antigens on the host cell surface [39].': 17, 'In an animal study to investigate H. pylori colonization in mice infected with both the wild-type and napA mutant strains, the degree of survival of the napA mutant was found to be much lower than that of the wild-type strain [40].': 41, 'Several studies showed that NAP can protect H. pylori DNA from damage, either due to its ability to bind DNA and thus to prevent DNA from attack by free radicals or through its iron-sequestering ability to reduce the oxidative stress produced in ferrous ion-mediated Fenton reactions [40], [41].': 48, 'However, for gastroduodenal diseases, only one study showed that the level of NAP-specific antibodies in sera from H. pylori-infected patients with gastric cancer was significantly higher than that from patients with chronic gastritis [42].': 34, 'No report has shown the direct association of NAP with H. pylori-induced gastric inflammation in patients so far.': 18, 'Interestingly, NAP can also stimulate either neutrophils or monocytes to increase the expression of IL-12, and induces T helper cells to differentiate toward the T helper 1 phenotype [43].': 29, 'Thus, NAP has been suggested as an immunotherapeutic anticancer agent and adjuvant for vaccination in clinical applications.': 17, 'Further study showed that NAP-activated DCs had a Th1 cytokine secretion profile, with high IL-12 and relatively low IL-10 secretion.': 20, 'Therapeutic effects of NAP can be mediated by the maturation of DCs and subsequent activation of Ag-specific T-cells, in addition to provoking innate immunity [44].': 25, 'However, further studies are required to confirm that activation of DC by NAP can be an adjuvant for DC-based cancer vaccines and cancer immunotherapy.': 24, 'Heat shock protein 60\nHeat shock proteins, a highly conserved protein family detected not only in prokaryotes but also in eukaryotes, are induced by a variety of environmental stresses such as temperature, pH change, ischemia, and microbial infection.': 38, 'H. pylori produces mainly two Hsps, GroES-like HspA (Hsp10), and GroEL-like HspB (Hsp60).': 13, 'The high expression of Hsp60 at low pH, which interacts with the receptor-like sulfatide (sulfoglycolipid), indicates the stress of acid may change the specificity of H. pylori to receptors [33], [45].': 31, 'Heat shock protein has been identified as one of the potential immunogens of the bacterium that induces IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and GRO production from monocytes or gastric epithelial cells [46].': 34, 'Hsp60 induces activation of NF-κB via TLR2 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and thereby induces human monocytes to secrete IL-8 [47].': 22, 'Moreover, anti-Hsp60 antibodies are consistently detected in H. pylori-infected patients, and the titers are associated with the progression of gastritis or gastric cancer [48], [49].': 25, 'Further study showed that mAbs against H. pylori Hsp60 could modulate bacterial pathogenesis by increasing IL-8 and TNF-α production [50].': 20, 'The pathogen-specific antibodies are supposed to execute potential immune functions rather than recognize or neutralize microbes.': 16, 'However, further studies are required to provide important insights into the role of anti-Hsp60 antibodies in H. pylori-associated gastric diseases.': 20, 'Blood group antigen binding adhesin (BabA and BabB)\nThree bab allelic types have been identified, including babA1, babA2, and babB.': 20, 'The molecular mass of the BabA protein is nearly 78 kDa, encoded by babA2.': 14, 'The babA1 and babA2 coding sequences are highly similar, but the translational start codon is lacking in babA1.': 18, 'H. pylori employs BabA to bind to fucosylated Lewis B blood-group antigen (Lewis b [Leb]) expressed on host gastric epithelium cells, when H. pylori initially infects the human stomach [30].': 30, 'The structure of the BabA receptor is similar to the O type blood antigen, and the statistics of epidemiology reveal the correlation between type O blood and gastric related diseases [51].': 31, 'Blood-antigen binding protein A and BabB are nearly identical in their 5′ and 3′ regions, with most of their sequence divergence being in their mid-regions.': 25, 'Importantly, the middle region of the BabA sequence determines the adhesion ability of BabA.': 14, 'In the western countries, the expression of BabA contributes to increased risk of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer [52], [53].': 21, 'However, the existence of BabA is not correlated to gastric related diseases in Asians [52], [54].': 16, 'The function of BabB is still unclear, but the expression of BabB was associated with increased gastric histologic lesions in patients [55].': 22, 'Some strains do not carry babA2 in their genome, or are deficient in BabA resulting from mutation, yet the bacteria still express a chimeric BabB/A (which has the ability to bind to the Leb antigen) by genetic recombination of babA1 and babB in certain conditions [56], [57].': 47, 'To study the dynamics of Leb adherence during human infection, a study analyzed paired H. pylori isolates obtained sequentially from chronically infected individuals.': 23, 'The results showed that a complete loss or significant reduction of Leb binding was observed in strains from 5 out of 23 individuals, indicating that the BabA-Leb binding phenotype is quite stable during chronic human infection.': 36, 'Sequence comparisons revealed that most amino acid changes were found in the putative N-terminal extracellular adhesion domain [58].': 18, 'In conclusion, recombination mediates dynamic changes in adherence properties, which suggests that it contributes to the persistence and adaption of H. pylori in ever-changing gastric environments [56], [58].': 28, 'Sialic acid-binding adhesin\nAt sites of vigorous local inflammatory response due to H. pylori infection, the expression of sialyl-Lewis x glycosphingolipid (sLex) antigen is increased on the cellular surface.': 29, 'This suggests that SabA adhesin plays a critical role to assist H. pylori to adhere to and colonize the gastric epithelium cells of a patient with gastritis [31], [59].': 29, 'Especially when lacking gastric Leb expression, Lex and Lea were closely related to H. pylori colonization [60].': 17, 'The sabB gene is homologous to sabA, but appears not to be involved in sLex binding [31].': 17, 'Therefore, the function of sabB in bacterial adhesion and pathogenesis is worth investigating.': 13, 'The prevalence of sabA in clinical strains is nearly 80%, and the sequence results revealed two types of sabA genotypes [59].': 21, 'The expression of type I sabA is regulated by a CT repeat sequence in the 5′ ORF of sabA, and this repeat can be regulated by slipped strand mispairing (SSM) [59], [61].': 32, 'The functional protein is only expressed in those strains in which the numbers of the CT dinucleotide repeats are 4, 7, and 10, and allow an ORF encoding the full length SabA.': 32, 'This expression status is defined as “On”.': 7, 'When the CT repeat number is varied to 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 11, there will be early stop codons in the ORF resulting from frame-shift.': 27, 'In this status, the gene expression is defined as “Off”, and the truncated SabA is expressed.': 16, 'The type II sabA has a unique deletion of the CT repeats and a distinctive sequence in this region.': 19, 'Moreover, not only sabA, but also adhesins oipA and hopZ genes, are characterized by CT dinucleotide repeats in their 5′-coding regions [62].': 22, 'The expression of SabA detected by western blotting is dramatically different from the sequence-based prediction [59].': 16, 'In type I strains, which are predicted to be “On”, the expression of SabA is only 43% by western blotting.': 20, 'showed the length of a polyT tract close to the sabA promoter region is variable, with the variation also arising through SSM [61].': 23, 'In addition, the length of the polyT tract is supposed to modulate sabA promoter activity, providing an alternative mechanism for transcriptional regulation in H. pylori, which possesses a limited repertoire of classical trans-acting regulatory factors [61], [63], [64].': 38, 'A mixed-genotype population is developed by SSM during infection by H. pylori which may benefit bacterial immune evasion and adaptation to different hosts.': 23, 'The analysis of clinical statistics indicates that in patients infected with SabA-positive strains, the density of H. pylori in the body is dramatically higher than in patients infected by SabA-negative strains [59].': 32, 'This finding indicates that SabA interacting with the sLex antigen can enhance H. pylori colonization in those patients with weak or no Leb expression [59].': 25, 'Although the intensity of Leb is the key host factor regulating H. pylori density in patients with a babA2-positive H. pylori infection, the weakness of the sLex-mediated adherence, and its metastable On/Off switching resulting from phase variation, may benefit H. pylori by allowing escape from sites where bactericidal host defense responses are most vigorous.': 54, 'Step 4: Toxin and host tissue damage\nCytotoxin-associated gene A\nThe epidemiological prevalence of CagA-positive H. pylori infection in western countries is nearly 60% [65], [66], and the prevalence is about 90% in Asian countries [67], [68].': 37, 'Several studies indicated that the CagA-positive strains are directly associated with acute gastritis, gastric ulcer, and gastric cancer development [69], [70], [71].': 22, 'As a result, the virulence of individual H. pylori isolates has been measured by their ability to produce CagA.': 19, 'Cytotoxin-associated gene A protein can be further divided into the Western-type CagA and East Asian-type CagA, by the repeat sequence Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala (EPIYA) motifs at the N-terminus of CagA [72], [73].': 30, 'The affinity of the East Asian-type CagA to SHP-2 is significantly higher than that of the Western-type CagA [72], [73].': 20, 'As a result, East Asian-type CagA induces more cytoskeleton changes, and is more likely to be associated with gastric cancer [73].': 21, 'The cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI) is located on the chromosome in H. pylori, is 35–40 kb, and contains more than 30 genes [62].': 23, 'Among them, cagPAI carries at least 6 genes with homology to type IV secretion systems, and thus translocate the bacterial protein CagA into the host gastric cell cytoplasm upon contact with epithelium cells [74].': 34, 'Moreover, several proteins, including CagL, and CagY, that are present in the T4SS use β1-integrin as a receptor to deliver CagA into the host cell [75], [76].': 27, 'The translocated CagA protein localizes to the inner surface of the plasma membrane via interactions with phosphatidylserine and subsequently undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by the Src family protein tyrosine kinase.': 29, 'However, once injected into the cytoplasm via the T4SS, CagA can alter host cell signaling in both a phosphorylation-dependent and phosphorylation-independent manner.': 22, 'The phosphorylated CagA binds to the phosphatase SHP-2 and affects the adhesion, spreading, and migration of the cell [72], [77].': 20, 'Moreover, CagA can also affect the host cell in several aspects, such as the formation of gastric epithelium cell pedestals, the change of the cytoskeleton, affecting the proliferation of cells, and stimulating the gastric epithelium cells to secrete IL-8 [78], [79], [80].': 42, 'Cytotoxin-associated gene A has phosphorylation-independent effects, many of which remain unclear.': 11, 'A conserved motif in the C-terminus of the nonphosphorylated CagA has recently been identified, and was shown to interact with the host hepatocyte growth factor receptor met, which contributes to cellular proliferation and inflammation via the Akt signaling pathway, which activates NF-κB and β-catenin [81].': 45, 'Vacuolating cytotoxin A\nVacuolating cytotoxin A is predicted to encode a protoxin with a mass of about 140 kDa, but the secreted VacA toxin is composed of the p33 and p55 domains that form an oligomeric structure.': 37, 'This complex can embed into the host cell membrane, and also has the characteristic of an anion-selection channel.': 18, 'This channel can release bicarbonate and organic anions in the host cytoplasm [82].': 13, 'In this way, the channel might help H. pylori colonization by allowing the efflux of potential metabolic substrates for bacterial growth.': 21, 'This complex can also get into the endosome via endocytosis.': 10, 'The endocytosed VacA channel will allow anions to permeate into late endosomes, which leads to accumulation of weak bases and thence to large vacuole formation by water influx [83], [84].': 30, 'Previous studies also indicate that VacA applied extracellularly apparently targets mitochondria, since it induces the release of cytochrome C, ER stress, and apoptosis [85].': 24, 'In addition, VacA disrupts the balance of cell proliferation and death by affecting genes that regulate the cell cycle.': 19, 'It also can induce acute inflammatory responses through inducing host cell release of IL-8 [86].': 15, 'All H. pylori strains carry the vacA gene encoding protein production, with various degrees determined by the different genopatterns of the signal sequence (s1a, s1b, s1c, and s2), mid-region (m1, m1T, and m2), and the intermediate region (i1, i2, and i3) [87], [88].': 43, 'The genotype can be divided into different subtypes, according to the combinations of the diversity of these three regions [87], [88].': 21, 'For the genotype s1/m1, the expression of VacA is highly active and can damage cells in a more acute manner [87].': 21, 'It has been shown that H. pylori vacA s1 and m1 strains are associated with high levels of inflammation in the gastric mucosa and increased risk for gastric atrophy and carcinoma, compared with the less virulent vacA s2 and m2 strains [89].': 42, 'Furthermore, the vacA i1 genotype is strongly associated with vacA s1, vacA m1, and cagA-positive genotypes, while the vacA i2 genotype is closely associated with vacA s2, vacA m2, and cagA-negative genotypes [88].': 33, 'A previous study showed that, in patients with gastric cancer, the vacA s1a and s1c subtypes are less common, and m1T is more prevalent in patients with peptic ulcer and chronic gastritis [90].': 33, 'However, the association of vacA subtypes with disease is not consistent in different countries.': 14, 'Although H. pylori is generally viewed as an extracellular microorganism, Chu et al.': 13, 'showed that in a gentamicin protection assay on AGS or MKN45 cells, H. pylori could invade the epithelial cells and multiply within double-layer vesicles either on the plasma membrane or in the cytoplasm.': 33, 'The autophagic vesicles induced by H. pylori are supposed to be the location of replication, and also of the degradation of the replicating bacteria after fusion with lysosomes [91].': 29, 'The multiplication of H. pylori within cells provides a niche for its resistance to antibacterial therapy and has a significant impact on its biological life cycle.': 26, 'In addition, the VacA or CagA mutants of H. pylori have lower levels of multiplication in macrophages [92].': 18, 'H. pylori infection is supposed to induce autophagosome formation, and these autophagic vesicles are adapted for the multiplication of H. pylori in the host.': 24, 'The use of different host cell lines and bacterial strains has produced inconsistent results, indicating that H. pylori may affect autophagy in a host cell/bacterial strain dependent manner [93].': 29, 'However, it is still uncertain whether autophagy serves as an effective front line of host defense against intracellular H. pylori, and the precise mechanisms by which H. pylori exploits host cell machineries for intracellular survival are poorly understood.': 38, 'As a result, the investigation of the roles of vacA, cagA, and other virulence factors in H. pylori intracellular multiplication is necessary.': 22, 'Conclusions\nIn summary, over the past year, the knowledge of H. pylori pathogenesis and disease development has been improved by the studies focusing on investigation of bacterial factors.': 28,

immunity by prokaryotes against foreign MGEs is achieved through the formation of RNA-guided endonucleases, which constitute the effector complexes and are able to detect secondary infection by a foreign DNA that was previously incorporated into the CRISPR array [10].': 41, 'The CRISPR-Cas systems are classified into two classes (Classes 1 and 2) that are subdivided into six types (types I through VI).': 22, 'Class 1 (types I, III and IV) systems use multiple Cas proteins in their CRISPR ribonucleoprotein effector nucleases and Class 2 systems (types II, V and VI) use a single Cas

12, '1), each step needs specific Cas proteins encoded by the cas genes near the CRISPR array, together with other accessory proteins [2,28,29].': 22, 'The CRISPR-Cas adaptation stage involves the identification and extraction of the protospacer from the invading DNA/RNA and its subsequent incorporation into the CRISPR array.': 24, 'Both these functions are performed by the versatile Cas1-Cas2

CRISPR-Cas12a.': 7, 'A recent cryo-EM analysis on the intermediate catalysis products of Cas12a [36] revealed that the enzyme utilizes a further three-checkpoint control to sense the hybridization between the crRNA and the DNA.': 31, 'Three regions within the enzyme, the ‘REC linker’, the ‘lid’ and the ‘REC finger’ sequentially scan the hybrid through conformational changes and only when all three checkpoints are able to recognize the hybrid, the enzyme is in a conformation competent for catalysis.': 42, 'The endonuclease produces a staggered cut on a PAM distal site on the DNA with a 5 nt overhang on the target strand [31,36], and the PAM distal end of the cleaved product is then released from the complex [39].': 40, 'Cleavage in the t-strand of the DNA by Cas12a produces a 5′-phosphorylated product [35].': 14, 'In order for both DNA strands to be cut, they must enter the catalytic site with a 5′-3′ polarity.': 19, 'Structural studies reveal that the NTS is positioned to enter the RuvC-Nuc pocket with the 5′-3′ polarity, while the TS has the reverse polarity.': 24, 'An smFRET analysis suggests that Cas12a has to undergo conformational changes in the distal part of the REC and NUC lobes in order to allow the TS enter the nuclease site with the correct polarity [36].': 36, 'This could explain why the NTS appears to be hydrolyzed faster than the TS.': 14, 'Therefore, the cleavage of the NTS is a consequence of the proper positioning of this strand in the RuvC-Nuc catalytic pocket rather than a requirement to initiate the cleavage reaction.': 30, 'After both strands have been cleaved, the PAM distal end of the cleavage product dissociates from the complex, but the PAM proximal site remains associated to Cas12a forming a cleaved R-loop [24,39].': 32, 'Indiscriminate ssDNA cleavage\nBesides high-specific dsDNA cleavage, Cas12a has also been shown to exhibit indiscriminate ssDNA degradation activity upon activation with a ssDNA complementary to the crRNA guide.': 28, 'This activity is displayed by all Cas12a orthologs and degrades any available ssDNA molecule into single/double nucleotides [40].': 18, 'Comparisons of the structures of Cas12a before, during and after cleavage reveal the structural changes that result in such an indiscriminate activity.': 22, 'The lid region, which is involved in the checkpoints for accurate target recognition [36] is responsible for this action.': 19, 'Before the crRNA-DNA hybrid is formed, the lid occludes the cleft where the catalytic residues reside.': 16, 'Upon formation of the hybrid, the lid changes conformation to form an α helix, thus interacting with the crRNA of the hybrid assembly, thus dissociating the polar interactions and making available the catalytic pocket.': 34, 'In the R-loop structure after cleavage [24], this region appears disordered indicating that the catalytic site is accessible after the distal part of the dsDNA substrate dissociates from the complex.': 30, 'Therefore, the catalytic cleft is open and able to sever ssDNA indiscriminately.': 12, 'This molecular mechanism would explain how ssDNA molecules are degraded by Cas12a after being activated by the presence of the RNA-DNA hybrid [24,35,36].': 23, 'In addition, recent studies have reported non-specific nicking of target sequences bearing mismatches in distal regions of the target DNA [41], suggesting that this could be a problem for potential applications.': 31, 'Cas12a endonuclease recycling\nUnspecific ssDNA degradation presents a potential harmful situation for the host cell since it could hinder basic cellular processes such as replication, transcription and DNA repair.': 29, 'This poses an important question: how could we eliminate this harmful indiscriminate activity?': 13, 'As the cell cannot allow an indiscriminate ssDNA degradation unleashed.': 10, 'The answer to these problems can be found in the bacterial genomes encoding Cas12a.': 14, 'Use of a conserved sequence of the crRNA for a database search disclosed that different bacteria encode a single copy of the Cas12a gene, whereas they encode multiple copies (up to 68) of the crRNA [18].': 36, 'If the transcription rates are presumed to be similar, at any given time, the concentration of various crRNAs in the cell would be multiple times higher than that of the enzyme.': 31, 'It has been experimentally shown that with sufficient concentration of a new crRNA molecule, it is able to displace the cleaved R-loop from the enzyme, with the help of accessory host proteins, forming a new interference complex (Fig.': 38, 'This shows that Cas12a can revert the active conformation to shut down unspecific activity by displacing the cleaved R-loop with a new crRNA.': 23, 'In doing so, it reverts back to a conformation where the molecular ‘lid’ forms polar interactions again to make the catalytic pocket inaccessible [36].': 24, 'By doing so, not only does the endonuclease shut down the indiscriminate ssDNase activity, but also recycles its catalytic activity towards other target DNAs.': 24, 'Cas12a vs Cas9\nCas12a and Cas9 have striking functional similarities despite having evolved through independent pathways (Fig.': 17, '2, Fig.': 2, '4), with similar sizes (1368 amino acids for SpCas9; 1307 for FnCas12a).': 12, 'They are both multidomain effector proteins and adopt a bilobed

is processed into mature crRNAs before it can form an RNP with the endonuclease.': 27, 'In the case of Cas9, the tracrRNA (encoded close to the CRISPR locus) first needs to hybridize with the pre-crRNA, and then this hybrid RNA–RNA duplex structure is recognized by Cas9, following which the host RNase III cleaves the duplex, leaving a ∼75 nt long tracrRNA and a 39-42 nt long crRNA, which then forms the RNP complex responsible for recognizing and degrading the target DNA [33,42,43].': 67, 'In contrast, Cas12a does not require a tracrRNA or RNase III, since the protein processes its own crRNA in its ribonuclease catalytic site [44].': 24, 'In type-V CRISPR locus of F. novicida, the spacers are 27–32bp sequences interspersed by 36bp repeat sequences in between the spacers.': 21, 'In the entire CRISPR array transcript, which is the pre-crRNA, the repeat derived sequences form pseudoknots, which are recognized by Cas12a.': 21, 'Following the recognition, the pre-crRNA is cleaved forming ∼43 nt mature crRNA [25,26,31,34,35,45].': 13, 'Logistically, Cas12a presents a more minimalistic system than Cas9.': 9, 'For Cas9 targeted DNA sequences, the PAM is situated downstream of the spacer sequence on the non-template strand, and is recognized by the PI domain, which is primed for identifying a 5′-NGG-3′ PAM [43,46].': 34, 'In contrast, Cas12a recognizes A-T rich sequences, with the PAM, typically 5′-TTTV-3′, located upstream of the spacer.': 17, 'Upon PAM recognition, the target DNA is unzipped and hybridization of the RNA-DNA takes place.': 15, 'For both enzymes exists a crucial seed sequence next to the PAM to determine the specificity of target DNA binding.': 20, 'The seed sequence for Cas9 is about ∼10 nt whereas for Cas12a it is about ∼5–6 nt [9,31,34,35].': 18, 'When the hybridization of the DNA with the RNA is complete, Cas9 cleaves the template strand and the non-template strands in the catalytic sites located in the HNH and the RuvC domains respectively, producing a blunt DSB, with the cleavage site being 3 base pairs upstream from the PAM sequence [9].': 51, 'However, in the case of Cas12a due to the presence of a single nuclease site, the strands of the DNA are cut in the same nuclease site.': 27, 'Since it has been shown that the two strands follow different pathways to reach the catalytic site, explaining the staggered DSB produced by Cas12a [24,31].': 25, 'Cleavage fidelity is an important issue for many of the nucleases used in genome editing applications [47].': 17, 'An optimal tool must introduce modifications just on the target site, leaving the rest of the genome unmodified in order to avoid undesired changes in other sites of the genome with unpredictable consequences.': 33, 'Therefore, specificity and the resulting cleavage products are key in genome modification applications.': 13, 'A recent comparison of different Cas12a and Cas9 from different species using nuclease digestion and deep sequencing (NucleaSeq) in vitro, revealed that both enzymes share similar types of specificities and tolerate similar mismatches [48], in contrast to in vivo reports that show the lower off-target effects of Cas12a [49,50].': 49, 'This apparent contradiction may be related to different recognition and cleavage kinetics, but also to a possible different behaviour of these cutters on a chromatin context, thus posing the question whether in vitro or in vivo approaches should be pursued for nuclease redesign efforts.': 44, 'CRISPR-Cas12a mediated genome editing\nApplication of CRISPR-Cas systems as molecular tools for genome editing exploits their ability to produce a double strand break (DSB) at a specific genomic locus, and depends entirely on the host cell DNA repair machinery to fix the lesion produced by these systems.': 47, 'The repair mechanisms can be either of the following processes: homology-directed repair (HDR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).': 18, 'HDR utilizes a template DNA that is homologous to the break site (an unbroken sister chromatid or a homologous chromosome) to repair the DSB, whereas NHEJ is based on direct joining of broken ends of the DSB, making NHEJ the more error prone mechanism of the two.': 47, 'HDR can thus be used to supply exogenous template DNA to implement a user defined change in the host genome.': 20, 'NHEJ can be applied for gene disruption whereas HDR allows for the scope of introducing new genetic information or direct correction of the sequence at a specific locus.': 28, 'At the center of CRISPR mediated genome engineering today is Cas9, with

regulation by Cas12a was successfully observed in bacteria, plants, as well as in mammalian cells [52,[54], [55], [56]].': 34, 'Cas12a can also serve as a solution in cell types where use of Cas9 is toxic, such as in some industrial strains of Streptomyces [54].': 25, 'Targeted mutagenesis in plants can also be achieved through co-expression of Cas12a and its cognate crRNA in vivo, as was shown in rice.': 23, 'Additionally, it was also shown that the mutagenesis was more efficient through the use of pre-crRNAs with full-length direct repeat sequences than with mature crRNAs [57].': 26, 'Efficient mutagenesis through delivery of the pre-assembled ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle was also observed in soybean and wild tobacco.': 18, 'The RNP was assembled from recombinantly expressed

e-cigarette smoke on oral and overall health are still scarce.': 27, 'This review discusses the possible health effects due to unregulated e-cigarette use, as well as the health effects of second-hand smoke and third-hand smoke on non-smokers.': 26, 'Keywords\nE-cigarettesTobaccoSmokingOral healthElectronic-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury\nTobacco leaves are the major materials used to make cigarettes, cigars, and pipe tobacco.': 23, 'Cigarette consumption and exposure is a worldwide issue that has devastating health, social, economic, and environmental consequences.': 17, 'Despite years of efforts to reduce tobacco consumption, the World Health Organization has estimated that tobacco use and exposure is currently responsible for the death of about six million people across the world each year [1].': 36, 'According to information from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service, the total economic cost of smoking is over $300 billion a year, which includes the direct cost of medical care and indirect cost of lost productivity [2].': 39, 'Cigarette smoke contains a deadly mix of more than 7000 chemicals, including hundreds that are toxic and approximately 70 that are known cancer-causing substances [3].': 25, 'Decades of studies have associated chemicals in tobacco smoke with higher risks of cardiovascular disease, cancer, pneumonia, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, impaired immune functioning, and genetic diseases of the fetus [2,3].': 31, 'Cigarette smoking also increases the risk of developing orofacial clefts in infants, and alveolar bone loss, periodontal disease, and oral mucosa cancer in adults [3].': 25, 'In addition, there is increasing evidence showing that smoking increases dental caries in permanent teeth and is a risk factor for dental implant failure [4,5].': 25, 'Although electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been described as a healthier substitute to tobacco smoking, the aerosol of e-cigarettes still contains a wide range of deleterious products [6].': 27, 'Chronic exposure to these substances at a much higher level than in the air remains a great health risk for smokers and people passively exposed to the e-cigarette vapor [7].': 30, "Electronic cigarettes and their impact on smokers' health\nE-cigarettes are classified as electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.": 24, 'They are battery-operated devices that were primarily designed to heat nicotine and flavoring containing chemical substances to produce a smokeless vapor called aerosol, which is inhaled by the user [8,9].': 30, 'The e-cigarette solution in the cartridge is referred to as e-liquid or e-juice and is generally comprised of nicotine, flavor ingredients in propylene glycol, and vegetable glycine.': 27, 'In addition, some vaping devices contain cannabis, which further broadens the composition and appeal of aerosols [10].': 17, 'The cartridge may also contain heavy metals such as nickel, tin, lead or chrome [11,12].': 15, 'Even though there are fewer components in e-cigarettes compared to conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes still contain toxic and cancer-causing residues, such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein [6].': 26, 'E-cigarettes are operated by a battery that generates an electrical current that ignites a filament located on an atomizer.': 19, 'The ignited filament evaporates the e-liquid in the cartridge to produce an aerosol.': 13, 'However, ignition of the filament also causes transfer of heavy metals and nanoparticles to the aerosol that can infiltrate the lungs and damage health [11].': 25, 'Some brands of e-cigarettes contain a sensor that detects the drag and initiates a cascade of events to activate the e-cigarette.': 21, 'When a sensor is not built in, a button that closes the system on the battery and generates the electrical current to power the filament is usually supplied.': 28, 'Depending on the brand, some devices have a LED light that shows when the device is activated or needs to be recharged [9,13].': 23, 'Some examples of ENDS devices are shown in Fig.': 9, '1\nDownload : Download

rapidly evolved since they were originally manufactured in China in 2003 by the pharmacist Hon Lik.': 20, 'There are four generations of e-cigarettes so far with differences including shape, size and prices [14].': 16, 'The first generation of e-cigarettes resembled closely conventional cigarette and were made of three components: the battery, and the atomizer which was either combined with or separated of the cartridge.': 30, 'The second generation, called cleoatomizers, operated via a multi-voltage battery, a removable filament and had a larger tank capacity that could be removed to refill with e-liquid [15].': 28, 'The third-generation devices, called “mods”, are characterized by a modified battery with varying voltages, wattage, and power capacity.': 18, 'The fourth generation devices operate with a fixed voltage battery and can have different battery styles and shapes, such as a USB flash drive [13].': 25, 'E-cigarettes are considered to be safer and healthier compared to conventional cigarettes [16].': 13, 'Consequently, ENDS use has drastically increased among smokers, including among U.S. youth.': 12, 'Among middle school and high school students, the use of e-cigarettes has continued to increase from 48% to 78% (from 2017 to 2018) [17].': 24, 'According to a survey with 45,971 U.S. adults and youth, 81% of youth who smoked tobacco products (aged 12–17 years old) reported that their first e-cigarette was flavored [18].': 29, 'Another study with 150,000 participants showed that 27% of individuals who have ever tried e-cigarettes continued to smoke at least once every 30 days [19].': 25, 'Regular e-cigarette use was higher in U.S. states with lower cigarette taxes compared with states that have higher cigarette taxes [19].': 21, 'Nicotine and its effects on smokers\nNicotine is found in conventional cigarettes and e-cigarettes and is the major chemical component responsible for addiction in tobacco products [3].': 27, 'According to e-cigarette manufacturers, a single e-cigarette device may contain as much nicotine as a pack of 20 conventional cigarettes [20].': 21, 'A recent CDC study demonstrated that 99% of the e-cigarettes sold in the U.S. contain nicotine, some labels do not disclose whether they contain nicotine, and some of them contain nicotine even though they are marketed as 0% nicotine [21].': 40, 'Using devices that contain nicotine during adolescence can impair parts of the brain responsible for attention, learning, mood, and impulse control.': 21, 'The brain continues to develop until approximately age 25 and every time a new memory is created, or a new skill is learned, stronger synapses are built between neurons.': 29, 'Nicotine can affect the way in which these synapses are formed.': 11, 'Using nicotine during adolescence may also increase the risk for future addiction to other drugs [22].': 16, 'In fact, a study with 1312 teenagers in Southern California showed that e-cigarette users were more likely to smoke conventional cigarettes after a one-year follow-up.': 25, 'Additionally, participants who used mods smoked >6 times as many cigarettes at follow-up compared with vape pen smokers [23].': 19, 'Effects of e-cigarettes on oral health and the oral microbiome\nThe oral microbiome is the second most abundant and one of the most diverse microbiomes in the body, comprising over 600 species, with distinct subsets predominating at different microenvironments [24].': 40, 'Under normal and healthy conditions, the oral microbiota is considered as a commensal because it exists in harmony with the individual host [25].': 23, 'However, under dysbiotic conditions, some bacterial species such as Porphyromonas gingivalis can lead to periodontal disease and others, such as Streptococcus mutans, can promote dental caries [25].': 27, 'There is a large body of evidence showing that conventional cigarette smoking is a risk factor for periodontal disease and dental caries [[26], [27], [28], [29]].': 26, 'However, studies on whether e-cigarettes are risk factors for dental caries and periodontal diseases are still scarce.': 17, 'The salivary microbiome analysis from 119 participants showed that the abundance of the Gram-negative bacteria Porphyromonas and Veillonella was higher among e-cigarette users compared with conventional cigarette smokers or never smokers [30].': 32, 'A pilot study with 20 recruited participants showed statistically significant increase in gingival inflammation when participants switched from smoking conventional cigarettes to e-cigarettes [31].': 24, 'However, the same study showed that high levels of variation in the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1β made these measurements not conclusive.': 25, 'A more controlled study involving 135 participants evaluated pro-inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α and MMP-8) in the oral cavity and showed increased levels of these markers in conventional cigarette-smokers compared with never-smokers; however, there were no differences between e-cigarette users and never-smokers [32].': 44, 'Regarding dental caries, an in vitro study shows that the combination of the viscosity of e-liquids and some classes of chemicals in sweet flavors may increase the risk of cariogenic potential.': 31, 'The data available so far must be interpreted with extreme caution, especially because different studies use different brands of e-cigarettes that may have large differences in composition.': 27, 'Electronic-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI)\nIt is likely that e-cigarette users can also experience systemic effects due to e-cigarette aerosol components.': 24, 'In recent investigations, the U.S. CDC, U.S FDA and U.S. state health authorities have linked hospitalizations to the use of vaping products [[33], [34], [35]].': 25, 'An outbreak with many patients showing acute and severe respiratory symptoms has compelled health agencies to conduct studies on e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI).': 27, 'Symptoms associated with EVALI include chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, nausea, and vomiting.': 14, 'According to the CDC, as of February 18, 2020, a total of 2807 hospitalized cases or deaths were reported from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands [[33], [34], [35]].': 36, 'Prevalence among cases of EVALI patients were: 15% were under 18 years of age, 78% (the majority) were between the age of 18 and 34, and 23% were over 34 years old.': 32, 'Hospitalized patients reported using vaping products that contained either nicotine or THC that they obtained from an informal source, shop or a dispensary [[33], [34], [35]].': 26, 'Screening bronchioalveolar lavage of EVALI patients have pointed to alpha tocopherol, otherwise known as vitamin E, as the potential cause of the disease due to its detection in 94% of patients with EVALI [36].': 34, 'Analysis by mass spectrometry of vaping products cartridges and pods received from patients showed that vitamin E was present in 80% of THC cartridges [37,38].': 25, 'As a supplement or an ointment, vitamin E is usually administered orally or applied on the skin and is harmless.': 20, 'However, when used as a diluent of vaping products, it could have toxic effects in the lungs, such as inducing strong inflammation [38].': 23, 'Fortunately, hospital admissions for patients with EVALI have significantly decreased since the peak of the outbreak in September 2019.': 19, 'In February 2020, the CDC has low numbers of hospitalizations on their database [[33], [34], [35]].': 16, 'Second-hand and third-hand smoke and their health impacts in non-smokers\nSecond-hand smoke is the smoke accidently inhaled by a non-smoker.': 20, 'Smoke and aerosols directly from conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes, marijuana, hookahs, and the smoke exhaled by smokers are considered second-hand smoke and aerosols.': 22, 'Second-hand smoke and aerosols from cigarettes, e-cigarettes, marijuana, and hookah are toxic and contains cancer-causing agents.': 16, 'Data from 192 countries worldwide showed that 40% of children, 33% of male non-smokers and 35% of female non-smokers were exposed to second-hand smoke in 2004 [39].': 27, 'In addition, 603,000 deaths were attributed to second-hand smoke, which corresponded to 1% of worldwide fatalities [39].': 17, 'According to the California Department of Public Health, over 50% of Californians were still exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke in 2018 [40].': 22, 'Second-hand smoke is harmful to the overall health and can lead to death by ischemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, asthma and lung cancer [39].': 25, 'Chemicals from e-cigarette aerosols, such as nicotine and cancer-causing alkaloids, were found to be transferred from a vape shop to a nearby business in a multiple-tenant retail building [41].': 29, 'Exposure to second-hand marijuana smoke can lead to accumulation of cannabinoid metabolites in bodily fluids, and people experiencing psychoactive effects after such exposure [42].': 24, 'Second-hand smoke is also dangerous to the general population but especially children.': 12, 'Some harmful effects to children involve increasing risks of respiratory symptoms, obesity, disorders of the ear, nose, throat and sleep-disorder breathing [43].': 22, 'Second-hand smoke can infiltrate into other units in a building [3]; therefore it is important to maintain as much smoke-free space as possible.': 23, 'Because second-hand smoke is visible, extensive research has been conducted approaching this issue.': 13, 'However, third-hand smoke is an understudied public health concern and the potential risks to human health are rising.': 18, 'Third-hand smoke is a relatively new phenomenon that was first described in 2009 [44].': 14, 'Third-hand smoke is the residue from tobacco smoke gases and particles (from conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and other tobacco products) that cling to nearby surfaces such as clothing, bags, skin, hair and furniture after tobacco product consumption.': 36, 'The residual tobacco smoke pollutants can persist for minutes to months in indoor environments and on surfaces [45].': 18, 'The exposure to third-hand smoke present in dust, air and surfaces can occur through dust ingestion, dermal absorption and inhalation [45].': 21, 'Young children are especially vulnerable due to their crawling, hand-to-mouth and exploratory habits.': 13, 'E-cigarettes were shown as a source of third-hand exposure to nicotine that was recovered from windows, walls, floor, wood and metals [46].': 22, 'Exposure to these residues can cause DNA damage and increase the risk for short-term and long-term health problems, including asthma and cancer [[47], [48], [49]].': 25, 'Traditional cleaning methods may not be effective in removal of third-hand smoke compounds due to their ability to strongly adhere to surfaces [50].': 23, 'In fact, it is estimated that vacuuming and wiping strategies may help to release the residual compounds from surfaces to the air as aerosols [50].': 25, 'To remove these third-hand smoke residues from surfaces, fabrics and other materials, regular cleaning and/or laundry should be performed.': 19, 'Can e-cigarettes help adults quit smoking?': 6, 'Outside of the U.S. (particularly in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe), e-cigarettes are viewed very differently.': 19, 'The National Health Services in the UK have embraced e-cigarettes as a harm-reduction strategy and safer alternative to the thousands of chemicals found in conventional cigarettes [51,52].': 27, 'The UK places limits on the amount of nicotine allowed in their e-cigarettes (up to 20 mg/mL of nicotine [53], whereas the U.S. has no limit (some brands currently have up to 87 mg/mL [54]).': 35, 'These different approaches to e-cigarettes have resulted in a dramatically different teenage e-cigarette rate in the UK, which is only 2% [55,56] compared to 20% in the US [57].': 29, 'These differences raise obvious questions for the US: Should nicotine levels in e-cigarettes be regulated?': 15, 'Should e-cigarettes be advocated as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes?': 11, 'Several studies and systematic reviews

double the abstinence rate after 1 year (18.8% compared to 9.9%) [58].': 26, 'In this study patients were randomly assigned to use e-cigarettes or a traditional nicotine-replacement product of their choice (patch, gum, lozenge, nasal spray, inhalator, mouth spray, mouth strip, and microtabs), and the patients on e-cigarettes had a higher cessation rate, lower levels of nausea, lower levels of phlegm production, but higher throat irritation.': 53, 'Liu et al.': 3, '[59] conducted a systematic review of 14 different studies and 35,665 participants, finding that the efficacy rate of

factors involved in γ-globin gene regulation or F-cell differentiation and survival are potentially of considerable interest as targets for increasing HbF levels.': 25, 'However, it remains difficult to modulate the function of factors other than enzymes or signal-dependent nuclear factors by disrupting DNA/protein or protein/protein interactions [41] and such modulation is particularly problematic for factors with important non-erythroid functions [42].': 37, 'Furthermore, any interference with erythroid transcription factors may result in the inappropriate disruption of erythropoiesis.': 15, 'Efforts are being made to design endonucleases capable of precisely disrupting the genomic sequences involved in the erythroid-specific expression of γ-globin repressors, as a

have been obtained [53], [58], [59], [60].': 28, 'In a study of beta-thalassemia patients of Iranian origin, polymorphisms of intron 2 of BCL11A were found to be correlated with the response to HU treatment [53].': 27, 'By contrast, in studies including patients with SCA, BCL11A levels and SNPs were not found to be correlated with HbF induction after HU treatment [58], [59], [60], suggesting an important role for BCL11A in controlling baseline HbF levels, but with other factors required for HU to increase HbF levels.': 49, 'It has also been shown that intergenic HBS1L-MYB SNPs are not correlated with HU treatment [53], [60].': 17, 'SNPs of HBG2, HBS1L-MYB and BCL11A can be used for the rapid screening of disease severity in newborns and to provide more personalized care [61], but pharmacogenomics approaches do not distinguish between patients responding well and poorly to HU treatment [62].': 41, 'The criteria for treatment should therefore not be based on these genetic characteristics.': 13, 'A number of genes involved in translation, ribosomal assembly and chromosome organization, but with no known function in normal, physiological β-globin switching, are deregulated in the erythroid cells of SCA patients treated with HU [58].': 35, 'As recently suggested, the difference between weak and strong responses to HU may lie in the constitutive activation of genes involved in the stress response and terminal erythroid differentiation, and of genes protecting cells against stress-induced apoptosis in patients with strong responses [63].': 43, 'Thus, the culture of erythroid progenitors and investigations of the expression profile of specific genes may make it easier to distinguish responders from nonresponders before the initiation of HU treatment in beta-thalassemia patients, but this possibility requires further study.': 39, 'Short trial periods on HU therapy (<3 months) are currently required to identify the patients most likely to respond to this treatment [48].': 23, 'A number of other non-selective compounds, including cytotoxic compounds, short-chain fatty acid derivatives (SCFAD) and erythropoietin (Epo), have been investigated and evaluated in clinical trials [64].': 26, 'Some are thought to act via epigenetic mechanisms.': 8, 'This is not surprising given (i) the strong correlation between epigenetic modification and the developmental pattern of globin gene expression [65], [66], [67] and (ii) the finding that some of the variation of HbF synthesis in adults may be linked to loci sensitive to epigenetic regulation [68].': 47, 'However, the mechanisms of action of these compounds are not fully understood because they belong to several categories, including cytotoxic and hypomethylating agents (5-azacytidine, decitabine, HU), cytotoxic and histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as butyrate derivatives, and anti-apoptotic factors (Epo or Kit ligand) [69].': 43, 'Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\nConventional therapies (red blood cell transfusion and iron chelation) improve the quality of life and survival of patients [70], but allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) currently offers the only hope of a definitive cure for patients with beta-thalassemia.': 44, 'HSCT was first successfully performed more than 30 years ago [71], [72].': 12, 'Several transplantation centers have since tried to categorize risk factors and to diversify HSCT procedures, with the aim of treating more patients, decreasing the risks of morbidity and mortality, and improving overall thalassemia-free survival.': 34, 'Several factors have been shown to affect patient outcome: severity criteria before transplantation (hepatomegaly, portal fibrosis and irregular chelation history), age at transplantation, stem cell source (peripheral blood, bone marrow, cord blood), histocompatibility (related matched, unrelated matched, mismatched, haploidentical), preparative conditioning regimen and pretransplant eradication of marrow hyperplasia.': 48, 'Despite the lack of evidence from randomized clinical studies comparing donor sources and/or conditioning regimens, HSCT is now widely accepted as a curative treatment [73] resulting in a long-term quality of life similar to that of the general population and higher than that of conventionally treated patients without active disease [74], [75].': 52, 'In a pioneering study, the group of Pesaro [76], [77] assigned young patients to three classes according to the absence or presence of one, two or three risk factors before transplantation: hepatomegaly > 2 cm, portal fibrosis and irregular chelation history (class 1 = no risk factor, class 2 = one or two risk factors and class 3 = three risk factors).': 62, 'The transplantation of HLA (human leukocyte antigen)-matched sibling donor (MSD) cells into young class 1 or class 2 individuals on myeloablative conditioning (14 mg/kg busulfan + 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide) and cyclosporin for graft-versus-host disease (GVDH) prophylaxis, gave excellent results (82–90% disease-free survival), but this treatment was highly toxic in pediatric class 3 patients (only 55% survived) [78], [79].': 58, 'Overall survival (OS) was increased to 74% by decreasing the dose of cyclophosphamide to below 200 mg/kg, but the probability of graft rejection (GR) remained high (35%) and event-free survival (EFS) remained low (49%) [80], probably due to inadequate immunosuppression and/or a failure to eradicate the massive erythroid hyperplasia.': 49, 'Due to long-term exposure to iron overload, most patients over the age of 16 years have class 3 characteristics, and early attempts to treat them by transplantation, with high-dose cyclophosphamide regimens, were highly disappointing.': 34, 'All six patients died from graft failure or graft-versus-host disease (GVDH) in one study [81].': 15, 'Use of a preparative regimen adapted to the risk factors identified in young patients improved the outcome for adult individuals, but OS remained low (63–65%).': 25, 'Rejection-free survival was slightly better than that for young class 3 patients (60–62%), mostly because rejection rates were lower in adults than in children, for unknown reasons [80], [81], [82].': 30, 'Overall, the results obtained for class 3 patients were much worse than those for patients with class 1 or class 2 beta-thalassemia.': 22, 'Chronic active hepatitis at the time of transplantation had a strong negative impact on OS in adults [82].': 18, 'Very few changes to the treatment of class 1 and 2 pediatric patients have occurred in recent years, with the exception of thiotepa, which is used to reduce rejection rates in patients under the age of four years [83].': 39, 'A subgroup of young class III patients, those under the age of eight years, with hepatomegaly >5 cm (class III high-risk (HR)) has been shown to have a much poorer clinical outcome after HSCT with a conventional conditioning regimen than other class III patients [84], [85].': 46, 'This subgroup of patients has a very high risk of GR and regimen-related toxicity.': 14, 'Lower intensity conditioning is thus required for both these patients and for adults [86].': 14, 'Conflicting results for transplant-related mortality were obtained when the myeloablative regimen was changed from busulfan and cyclophosphamide to treosulfan, fludarabine and thiotepa (TreoFluT), and this change did not improve GVHD and graft failure in mixed-class groups of patients [87], [88].': 40, 'However, in well identified groups of class III patients and, even more significantly, in the subgroup of class III HR patients, the use of a TreoFluT regimen was associated with significant improvements in survival and EFS, due to a significant decrease in the incidence of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) [89].': 50, 'In this study, the increase in the risk of rejection due to the lower intensity of conditioning was counteracted by the use of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) rather than BM cells.': 32, 'In pediatric class 3 patients, ablation of the expanded thalassemic marrow and stronger immunosuppression through the use of an intensified preparation regimen including HU, azathioprine, fludarabine and hypertransfusion increased event-free survival to 80–85% [90], [91].': 35, 'The use of this protocol in adults did not decrease transplant-related mortality, and thalassemia-free survival remained low [92].': 18, 'The inclusion of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) in the preparative regimen of pediatric patients from all classes, together with the adaptation of busulfan and cyclophosphamide concentrations, decreased the incidence of GVHD, minimized GR and transplant-related mortality and seemed to abolish the difference between patients from different Pesaro risk classes, in a recent survey carried out in Greece and France [93], [94].': 60, 'The transplantation of cord blood (CB) and bone marrow cells from a MSD offers a similar probability of long-term cure, but with a lower incidence of GVHD.': 27, 'The transplantation of PBSC yields lower rates of GR than bone marrow transplantation in class III patients receiving TreoFluT, but GVHD remains a concern when PBSC grafts are used [95].': 30, 'One of the main barriers to HSCT with cells from HLA-identical siblings is the limited availability of donors, which is, theoretically, 25% for any single sibling.': 26, 'The combined use of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and HLA matching provides a reliable source of stem cells from healthy siblings, but rates of successful transplantation after ovarian stimulation remain low [96].': 31, 'For most of the remaining patients, millions of HLA types are stored in national registries.': 15, 'The probability of finding an unrelated donor (UD) with 9/10 or 10/10 HLA-matches (HLA-A, -B, -C, –DRB1 and -DQB1) on the basis of high-resolution typing exceeds 70% for patients of European ancestry [96], but this likelihood depends on ethnicity [97].': 40, 'A prospective study of patients with hematologic malignancies suggested that the transplantation of cells with this degree of matching from an UD provides a likelihood of cure similar to that for the transplantation of cells from a MSD [98].': 39, 'In both adults and children with β-thalassemia, bone marrow transplantation from an UD selected on the basis of high-resolution typing yields success rates similar to those obtained with a MSD [99], [100], but with more severe GVHD.': 37, 'This approach is not widely used in adults, due to the high incidence of GVHD, transplant-related mortality and GR, but it may be used to treat children with class I/II β-thalassemia safely, provided that ATG is given [100].': 38, 'A highly promising recently developed protocol including marrow reduction and pretransplant immunosuppression, followed by low-intensity conditioning with ATG, has been shown to result in a low risk of toxicity and durable engraftment in class 3 HR patients receiving cells from unrelated and related donors; this approach merits more widespread testing, even in individuals with lower risk β-thalassemia [101], [102].': 59, 'Donor cells can also be obtained from CB samples.': 9, 'The transplantation of CB cells originating from HLA-identical siblings is a viable alternative to the use of adult samples in class I/II patients [103], [104], [105].': 26, 'Moreover, these cells have the theoretical advantages of tolerating a higher degree of HLA incompatibility than adult cells [106] and causing a lower incidence of acute and chronic GVHD [107].': 30, 'However, in a report compiling data from 32 transplant centers from 1996 to 2009, survival and disease-free survival were as low as 62% and 20%, respectively, in patients with β-thalassemia receiving CB cells from mismatched donors, after myeloablative conditioning [108].': 40, 'Graft failure was the chief cause of treatment failure other than death, which was linked to disease severity and the use of a non-adapted conditioning regimen.': 26, 'Multivariate analysis indicated that the principal factor associated with engraftment was the number of cells used.': 16, 'These results contrast with those of a Taiwanese study reporting the survival of 88% of young patients receiving one or two unrelated CB units after a full myeloablative regimen; 74% of these patients were disease-free five years after transplantation.': 39, 'Both chronic and acute GVHD occurred, but most cases were moderate [109].': 12, 'However, double cord transplants were performed in this study if a single unit contained too few nucleated CD34+ cells.': 19, 'More clinical trials are required.': 5, 'Gene therapy\nThe concept of gene therapy for beta-thalassemia emerged a long time ago and was included in a plan for the viable treatment for hemoglobinopathies as early as 1978 at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) [110].': 40, 'However, major technical issues were encountered and attempts to demonstrate the efficacy of infusions of transfected mouse cells in myeloablated animals were far from convincing [111], [112].': 27, 'The regulatory globin sequences required for high levels of production [113] and efficient methods for gene introduction [114] were not available at the time.': 24, 'The stemness properties of the manipulated bone marrow cells were unknown.': 11, 'Early attempts to treat beta-thalassemia patients by inserting the β-globin gene into bone marrow cells, in 1980, were completely unsuccessful and received an avalanche of criticism [115], [116].': 28, 'It is essential to achieve a satisfactory combination of high levels of sustained β-globin expression and the stable propagation of complex sequences.': 22, 'More than 25 years were required to achieve these goals, which were made possible by the characterization, isolation, size reduction, and blending of the β-globin locus regulatory elements and the advent of lentiviral vectors, which can transfer complex sequences into hematopoietic stem cells.': 43, 'The genetic elements required for the adult- and erythroid-specific expression of the β-globin gene were mapped close to the gene [117], [118], in the promoter region, the second intron and downstream from the polyadenylation signal [119], [120], [121].': 38, 'However, the combination of these elements in a single transgene yielded very low levels of β-globin gene expression in the erythroid cells of mice undergoing transplantation with genetically modified HSCs bearing the transgene [122], [123], [124].': 36, 'The discovery of the β-globin LCR, located in a 15,000-base region far upstream from the globin genes [125], [126], [127], was a major step forward.': 25, 'The use of this region made it possible to design β-globin transgenes that were strongly expressed in the erythroid cells of transgenic mice [128], [129].': 25, 'Over a period of 10 years, efforts were made to delineate the enhancer core elements of the LCR [129], [130], with the aim of decreasing the size of the DNA fragments used, such that the chimeric DNA constructs would be compatible with transfer vectors derived from gamma-retroviruses [131], [132].': 49, 'These vectors provided reasonable levels of β-globin transgene expression in vitro, but the transduction of mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) was suboptimal, resulting in limited and variable expression of the β-globin gene in vivo [133], [134].': 36, 'Gamma-retroviral vectors (γ-RVs) have three major defects: (i) limited cargo capacity, (ii) instability, and (iii) an inability to transduce non-dividing cells (most HSCs are quiescent [135]).': 26, 'These drawbacks precluded the efficient correction of beta-thalassemia by the infusion of genetically modified HSCs.': 15, 'As a result, the gene therapy community working on globin disorders rapidly abandoned the use of γ-RVs shortly after lentiviral vectors (LVs) derived from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1) became available.': 32, 'Not only were LVs able to transduce cells arrested at the G1-S boundary of the cell cycle [136], [137], they were also able to transfer much longer sequences than γ-RVs [138].': 31, 'This key characteristic is dependent on a molecular mechanism for inhibiting the splicing of the viral RNA before its packaging into lentiviral particles.': 23, 'This mechanism involves active transport of the full-length (unspliced) viral RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by the viral protein REV, which binds to the REV-responsive element (RRE) located within the viral RNA structure [139].': 36, 'The potential utility of incorporating this mechanism into complex LCR/beta-globin LVs was suggested by our discovery that unwanted RNA splicing is the key determinant of LCR/beta-globin γ-RV instability and low titers, and that this problem could be largely corrected by the removal of undesirable splice sites [131].': 47, 'Our groups and that of Sadelain then focused on obtaining proof-of-principle for the preclinical efficacy of LCR/beta-globin LVs in two mouse models of beta-hemoglobinopathies: murine beta-thalassemia [140] and transgenic mouse models of sickle cell disease [141].': 36, 'This approach was subsequently consolidated by other studies [142], [143], [144], [145], [146].': 13, 'For gene therapy for sickle cell disease, we decided to abandon the wild-type beta-globin gene, choosing instead to work with a variant we constructed, with an enhanced ability to inhibit HbS polymerization [141].': 33, 'This variant (βA−T87Q) was generated by introducing the codon for a specific amino-acid residue present in both the gamma-and delta-globin proteins (Q, glutamine) to replace the corresponding codon in beta-globin (T, Threonine) [147].': 33, 'The βA−T87Q variant has an additional key advantage for gene therapy trials in beta-thalassemia: it facilitates accurate quantification of the amount of vector-derived beta-globin produced or present in circulating red blood cells by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), even in beta-thalassemia patients receiving red blood cell transfusions or with β+-thalassemia [148].': 50, 'Such quantification is not possible after the transfer of the wild-type beta-globin gene.': 13, 'The biosafety of LVs has greatly improved in recent years, and there is now very little risk of producing replication-competent lentiviruses [149].': 22, 'Modifications have included splitting the genetic elements required for production of the viral core proteins, the elimination of accessory genes involved in virus infectivity, the replacement of the viral envelope with that of another class of virus, and the removal of the viral enhancer/promoter elements [150].': 46, 'Insertional mutagenesis, which led to leukemia in some patients receiving γ-RV transduced cells [151], [152], [153], [154], is a major concern when integrative vectors are used.': 26, 'Viral transcriptional activating elements have been shown to trigger oncogene activation, leading to the strong recommendation that these elements should be deleted from retroviral vectors used for gene therapy purposes [155].': 31, 'LVs have a better safety profile than γ-RVs in hematopoietic cells [156] and are less genotoxic than γ-RVs in transplanted mice [157], [158], due to the differential DNA targeting of the two vectors [159].': 34, 'Nevertheless, LVs in general [159], and β-globin-LVs in particular [160], preferentially integrate into active genes and disturb gene expression over large distances [161].': 23, 'Furthermore, the level of β-globin gene expression under the control of LCR enhancers is subject to position effects [162], [163].': 20, 'Following vector integration, levels of β-globin expression have been shown to be variable and to depend on the location of the vector in the chromatin in transplantation experiments in mice [164].': 31, 'Chromatin insulators placed between enhancers and promoters prevent interactions between these elements.': 12, 'They also buffer transgenes against chromosomal position effects [165], [166].': 10, 'Chromatin insulators derived from the chicken hypersensitive site-4 (cHS4) of the β-globin locus [166] were thus introduced into β-globin LVs, to increase efficacy and safety [148], [167].': 27, 'This modification led to a higher probability of β-globin expression and lower levels of position effect variegation in vitro [167].': 20, 'A LV encoding the mutated β-globin (βA−T87Q) was thus constructed.': 10, 'In this vector, referred to as LentiGlobin vector HPV569, the β-globin gene is under the control of the LCR and the β-globin promoter, and is surrounded by tandem copies of the cHS4 core element [148].': 35, 'Experiments in beta-thalassemia mice subjected to busulfan conditioning and transplantation with cells transduced with this vector showed them to have near-normal hemoglobin levels and to display no overall toxicity [168].': 30, 'Over the following few years, we performed a large body of experiments with the aim of applying to carry out a clinical trial.': 23, 'This involved efficacy and safety/toxicology studies in mice, and large-scale vector manufacture in good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions [148], [168], [169], [170].': 22, 'Specific qualified assays for quality assurance (QA)/quality control (QC) were also developed and approved by the regulatory authorities.': 18, 'The Sadelain group and several other groups also worked towards clinical trial applications [171], [172], [173].': 16, 'The differences between our own product and trial protocol and those of the Sadelain group include (1) differences in the boundaries of the beta-globin gene, beta-globin promoter and LCR elements, (2) the initial presence of the cHS4 insulator core in our vector, (3) an anti-sickling and chromatography-identifiable βA−T87Q-globin variant, (4) differences in vector manufacturing and purification, (5) full-dose intravenous busulfan treatment, but without the addition of an immunosuppressive agent, (6) applicability to both beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease due to our choice of the βA−T87Q-variant, and (7) initial focus on betaE/beta0-thalassemia major patients [148], [169], [170], [174].': 97, 'We were granted authorization to carry out clinical trials for both beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease in 2006 (the LG001 Study), by the French regulatory authority ANSM (Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé).': 38, 'In these trials, we used the GMP-grade HPV569 vector produced and controlled in the USA.': 15, 'This work [170], together with a clinical trial of gene therapy for adrenoleukodystrophy [175], constituted the first trial of the use of a LV for the treatment of an inborn genetic disease to be approved anywhere in the world.': 39, 'The first beta-thalassemia patient to be treated and who did not receive backup cells was an 18-year-old βE/β0 adult with clinical beta-thalassemia major who had been transfusion-dependent and on parenteral iron chelation therapy since early childhood and had undergone splenectomy at the age of six years, and for whom no HLA-MSD was available [169], [170], [174].': 56, 'Bone marrow cells were processed for CD34+ cell selection, transduced with the HPV569 lentiviral vector and thawed for release testing.': 20, 'The patient received an infusion of 3.9 × 106 cells/kg after busulfan conditioning at the fully myeloablative dose (12.8 mg/kg).': 20, 'Hematopoietic reconstitution was uneventful, and the patient became transfusion-independent one year after transplantation.': 13, 'Hemoglobin levels are stable, at about 8–9 g/dL 6.5 years later or 7.5 years since gene therapy, with a mean vector copy number close to 0.2 vector copy per myeloid cell [176].': 32, 'The transgenic hemoglobin accounts for one third of total hemoglobin (HbF, HbE and HbAT87Q).': 14, 'A number of transduced hematopoietic clones were detected among the lymphoid and myeloid cells.': 14, 'One dominant clone emerged in month 3 and stabilized around month 15.': 12, 'This clone accounted for less than 4% of the peripheral nucleated cells, and this percentage had fallen to less than 2% five years post-transplantation.': 24, 'In this clone, the vector was inserted at the high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) locus, compromising gene splicing and causing the premature termination of transcription.': 25, 'The compromised HMGA2 gene displayed transcriptional activation, generating large amounts of a truncated and active form of the protein in transduced cells.': 22, 'It was suggested, but not formally demonstrated, that there was a causal link between vector insertion at this locus, HMGA2 gene activation, and clonal dominance [170].': 26, 'High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of single erythroid colonies indicated that vector-derived βA−T87Q-globin expression output did not differ significantly between the HMGA2 integrant and colonies displaying integration at other chromosomal sites [170].': 32, 'Almost eight years after transplantation, there is no signs of clonal overgrowth or toxicity [176].': 15, 'Another patient underwent transplantation in November 2011, but the vector copy number was lower.': 14, 'This patient is still transfusion-dependent, and transgenic hemoglobin levels account for ≈5% of total hemoglobin [176].': 16, 'The first two clinical studies in which LVs were used to transduce HSCs for the treatment of β-thalassemia [170] and adrenoleukodystrophy [175] showed that one key restriction to fully effective treatment was the limited efficacy of stem cell transduction, which was only 10–20%.': 43, 'Other studies suggested that the protection provided by the cHS4 elements was variable [155], [177], and dependent on their position in the chromatin [178].': 24, 'Furthermore, the tandem copies of the cHS4 insulator inserted into the β-globin vector were prone to rearrangement, resulting in the regeneration of a single element upon vector insertion [168], [179].': 30, 'This single element had a lower level of enhancer-blocking activity than the tandem copies [180].': 15, 'The insertion of insulators into the vector was also shown to decrease vector titer [179], [181].': 16, 'It therefore seemed likely that the removal of the cHS4 elements from the vector would result in a LV with a higher transduction efficacy and a similar level of safety.': 30, 'We therefore simply removed cHS4 from LentiGlobin vector HPV569 to yield LentiGlobin vector BB305, which also contains a heterologous promoter to increase vector titers and yield [182].': 27, 'The production, concentration and purification protocols were improved [183].': 9, 'The new vector BB305 was compared with HPV569 in human cells and in a comprehensive mouse toxicology study [182].': 19, 'It was found to be more effective than the previous vector, with an equivalent and satisfactory level of safety [182].': 20, 'On the basis of these new preclinical results with LentiGlobin vector BB305 and the sustained positive outcome for a patient with the parental LentiGlobin vector HPV569 [170], both the ANSM (French) and the RAC/FDA (Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee/Federal Drug Administration, US) granted us approval, in 2013 and 2014, for three new clinical trials using LentiGlobin vector BB305 sponsored by the biotechnology company bluebird bio: (1) Trial NCT02151526 (HGB-205) in France, for both beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease, (2) Trial NCT01745120 (HGB-204) at multiple centers in the US, Australia and Thailand, for beta-thalassemia, and (3) Trial NCT02140554 (HGB-206), at multiple centers in the US, for sickle cell disease.': 107, 'The three trials follow essentially the same clinical transduction protocol as for the previous trial with LentiGlobin vector HPV569, although the BB305 vector is further purified by preparative chromatography.': 29, 'Very encouraging results have been obtained for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia major patients, and were presented by the corresponding clinical investigators at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in December 2014 [184], [185].': 35, 'For the HGB-205 trial, transplantation was carried out in two transfusion-dependent βE/β0 patients.': 13, 'Six months post-treatment,

other 3 patients underwent transplantation in November 2014, and too little time had elapsed for any meaningful conclusions to be drawn at the time of data release in December 2014.': 31, 'None of the subjects experienced a drug product-related adverse event in either of these trials.': 15, 'Vector integration site analyses showed polyclonal reconstitution without clonal dominance.': 10,

ensure optimal engraftment with transduced stem cells.': 30, 'The clinical data from this trial have yet to be formally released.': 12, 'Conclusion\nFuture treatments for beta-thalassemia will depend on the benefit/risk/cost ratios for conventional transfusion and iron chelation [70], γ-globin induction [186], allogeneic bone marrow transplantation [187] and gene therapy [170], and the availability of these treatments in the low-income countries in which most β-thalassemia patients live.': 46, 'Treatments with HU or with other γ-globin inducers, either alone or in combination, have

reported a group of children with chronic subdural hematoma and long bone fractures in 1946 [1] and then described the association between traumatic shaking, subdural hematoma and retinal hemorrhage [2], the recognition of various forms of child abuse substantially increased, but with different terminologies.': 62, 'In 1962, Henry Kempe named the victim as “the battered child” [3].': 12, 'In 1974, Caffey used another term “the whiplash shaken infant syndrome” to describe those injures in infants from shaking the extremities with whiplash-induced intracranial and intraocular bleedings [4].': 28, 'For many decades, “shaken baby syndrome” (SBS) has been a common term used by many physicians to describe abusive head trauma or inflicted traumatic brain injury on infants and young children [5].': 32, 'Other terminologies involving SBS included nonaccidental head injury or trauma, inflicted traumatic brain injury [6] or more inclusively, “shaken impact syndrome” [7].': 22, 'Finally, the American Academy of Pediatrics [8] and consecutively the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [9] recommend the term abusive head trauma (AHT) based on the understanding of the mechanisms and clinical spectrum of injury associated with abusive head injury.': 42, 'Although shaking alone has the potential to cause neurologic damage, blunt impact or a combination of shaking and blunt impact cause significant neurologic injuries [5,10].': 25, 'AHT typically involves injury to the intracranial structures or skull of an infant or child younger than 5 years old as a result of violent shaking and/or blunt impact.': 29, 'The outcome ranges from complete recovery to significant brain damage and even death.': 13, 'Brain injuries are the most common cause of traumatic death in children less than 2 years.': 16, 'Early diagnosis is essential but may be challenging.': 8, 'It is often difficult for health professionals to recognize AHT due to often lack of external signs of AHT or abuse [11].': 22, 'The diagnosis of pediatric AHT should only be made following careful history taking, detailed physical examinations, and relevant testings.': 19, 'Epidemiology\nAHT is difficult for accurate diagnosis, therefore, the incidence is uncertain.': 12, 'This is due to the absent centralized reporting system, no obvious signs of abuse, various presentations, and acute head trauma not being a single isolated event rather a result of chronic maltreatment [12,13].': 33, 'The morbidity and mortality from AHT are noticeable.': 8, 'The first population-based study in the United States reported 29.7/100,000 person-years in children less than one year [14].': 18, 'Another study from Scotland [15] reported the incidence as 24.6/100,000 children younger than 1 year of age.': 17, 'International surveys also demonstrated that shaking is a frequent disciplinary problem worldwide, making it a leading cause of infant mortality and morbidity throughout the world [[16], [17], [18]].': 28, "In Taiwan, there was an analysis of national data on the characteristics and trends of injury among Taiwan's victims of hospitalized child abuse from National Health Insurance (NHI) Database, in which AHT was the most common injury, with infants younger than 1 year being the highest percentage, among 1212 victims of hospitalized child abuse during the period 1997–2009 [19].": 59, 'Etiology\nThere are several risk factors for AHT including certain behaviors and situations that involve the child individual, the family, and the caregiver.': 23, 'In the individual level, infantile colic or inconsolable cry is one risk factor [20,21].': 14, 'Infant crying is greatest at 6–8 weeks of age, consequently, AHT peaks during this same period [22].': 17, 'The disability of the child is another risk factor for maltreatment [23].': 12, 'In the family level, frustration intolerance, lack of prenatal care and childcare experience, low education level, low socioeconomic status, single-parent families and young parents without support are risk factors [[24], [25], [26]].': 32, "AHT perpetrators are the father or stepfather, mother's boyfriend, female babysitter, and the mother, in sequence [[27], [28], [29]].": 19, 'Risks at a community level are isolation, little recreational facilities, and poverty [30,31].': 13, 'All these factors increase the chance of child abuse.': 9, 'Child abuse occurs in all ethnicities, socioeconomic groups, and races, with boys more commonly affected.': 15, 'Infants tend to have increased morbidity and mortality with physical abuse [32].': 12, 'Pathophysiology\nAHT is one of the most serious forms of child abuse.': 12, 'It is the number one cause of death in children younger than 2 years old [17].': 16, 'AHT mostly begins with anxiety and frustration over a screaming infant that does not stop crying due to various factors such as feeding problems or infantile colic [21].': 28, 'The major mechanism of AHT is shaking injuries that occur from the consequence of repetitive rapid flexion, extension, and rotation of the head and neck [33].': 26, 'The rapid striking of the brain on the skull can tear vessels resulting in bleeding around the brain.': 18, 'Enlarging hematoma may then cause pressure within the skull, leading to increased intracranial pressure (IICP) and more brain damage.': 19, 'Furthermore, sheering forces across the brain can damage nerve axons resulting in diffuse axonal disruption.': 15, "Infant's heads are relatively large and heavy, and the neck muscles are too weak to support a large head.": 19, 'Rapid and repetitive flexion, extension, and rotation may result in greater parenchymal movement.': 13, 'The impact of the head against an object will include additional injuries such as lacerations, bruises, and fractures.': 18, 'AHT typically composes primary and secondary injuries.': 7, 'The primary injuries include skull fracture, cortical contusion, diffuse axonal injury, epidural, subdural, subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhages.': 17, 'The secondary injuries, usually the complications of the primary injuries, include diffuse brain edema, herniation, infarction or cerebrovascular accidents.': 19, 'While primary injuries are the consequence of the initial direct trauma or impact, secondary injuries are biomolecular inflammatory changes causing the disintegration of neurons and interruptions in the microcirculation of the brain [34].': 33, 'The consequence of cellular and biochemical events that occur within minutes in the brain and continues for months after the primary brain injury will lead to ongoing traumatic axonal injury and neuronal damage and finally neuronal death.': 37, 'Cerebral blood flow is compromised and IICP leads to tissue destruction.': 11, 'Autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is then impaired and causes further damage.': 12, 'Axons are more easily disrupted because of the shearing of long white matter tracts with acceleration-deceleration injuries [35].': 18, 'The neurometabolic cascade is similar to that of traumatic brain injury, as shown in [Table 1].': 16, 'Neurometabolic cascades of traumatic brain

several biological and mechanical factors.': 20, 'The head is, in proportion to the rest of the body, larger and tend to be injured first as they fall.': 21, "A child's brain has a relatively higher water content than adults, so the brain is more likely to suffer acceleration-deceleration injuries.": 21, 'The skull is not fully developed and easily compressed, which further causes coup injuries of the underlying brain tissue.': 19, 'Clinical features\nMaking a diagnosis of AHT is somewhat difficult.': 10, 'After trauma, infants and children may have findings ranging from nonspecific symptoms

smile, poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, increased sleeping and failure to thrive.': 26, 'The most severe trauma cases may present with life-threatening symptoms and signs including apnea, severe respiratory distress, bulging fontanel, decreased consciousness, seizures, and shock.': 24, 'However, the care givers often delay carrying the child for treatment until the last moment, and delayed

acceleration-deceleration force causing the brain to move within the fixed venous vessels and skull.': 19, 'Hemorrhages will then occur in the subarachnoid and subdural space if there is tearing of the superficial cortical veins.': 19, 'Subdural hematomas often locate in the convexity, interhemispheric fissure or infratentorial space.': 12, 'Retinal hemorrhages\nRetinal hemorrhage is significantly more common and more severe in AHT than accidental injury in infants.': 18, 'Retinal hemorrhage in AHT involves the retina, more often from the posterior pole of the eye to other parts and usually bilateral involvement [18,40].': 24, 'Ophthalmology consultation within the first 24 h is important since small or superficial hemorrhages often resolve quickly.': 17, 'Retinal hemorrhage has the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of child abuse of 75% and 93%, respectively [6].': 19, 'Less dramatic retinal hemorrhages may also be found in children with accidental head trauma, birth trauma, coagulopathy, and CNS infection.': 20, 'Retinal hemorrhages associated with accidental trauma were always mild.': 9, 'However, healthcare providers should not use retinal hemorrhage alone to diagnose AHT.': 12, 'Skull fractures\nSkull fractures occur as a result of a direct force applied to the head.': 16, 'AHT often be considered when the fracture is complex, diastatic (width greater than 3 mm), multiple, and non-parietal.': 18, 'Any of these types of skull fractures may suggest the possible existence of AHT [41].': 15, 'Rib fractures\nRib fractures are common in child abuse.': 9, "They usually occur as the result of squeezing the infant's chest wall, which produces anterior-posterior compressive forces resulting in rib fractures.": 21, 'The fractures are easily detected on routine chest x-ray or a skeletal survey.': 13, 'Accidental rib fractures are uncommon and rib fractures from CPR are also very rare.': 14, 'Any infant or child with a rib fracture or a history that does not support trauma should refer to further clinical investigations including a chest x-ray and a skeletal survey.': 30, 'Other fractures\nLong bone, posterior rib, or metaphyseal corner fractures are often seen in AHT [42].': 16, 'Metaphyseal fractures may involve the distal and proximal tibia, proximal humerus, and distal femur.': 14, 'They appear to have a curvilinear structure coming from the metaphysis.': 11, 'Often found in infants and children, they are highly specific for child abuse.': 13, 'The mechanism is shearing and torsional strains of the metaphysis caused by shaking or twisting on the extremities.': 18, 'Unexplainable cervical spine injuries or fractures should also lead to the possibility of AHT.': 14, 'The prior role of the triad (subdural hematoma, retinal hemorrhages, and encephalopathy) associated with traumatic shaking in the medical diagnosis of AHT is limited, showing low-quality evidence in a systemic review [43,44].':

review of the signs and symptoms.': 11, 'Clinicians should ask open-ended questions that can minimize masked information and allow the opportunity to get alternative explanations for the injuries.': 21, 'A history of non-accidental trauma or falling from a low height is the most common history suggestive of AHT.': 19, 'A changing history may also suggest the possibility of AHT or child abuse.': 13, 'If more than one caretaker was involved, they should be interviewed separately.': 12, 'An inconsistent history is a red flag for abuse.': 9, 'The physical examination should include a detailed assessment from head to toe, particularly the neurologic findings.': 16, 'Laboratory tests\nLaboratory studies should include complete blood cell count with platelet count, chemistry panel, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, amylase, lipase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and urinalysis.': 28, 'The laboratory evaluation may suggest AHT by the discovery of additional injuries that support the evidence of child abuse.': 19, 'Imaging\nImaging studies are the most important tests to confirm AHT.': 11, 'The clinician should obtain a skeletal survey and

'The diffusion-weighed MRI may be particularly considered for an accurate diagnosis of parenchymal ischemic changes at acute stage and correlated with prognosis [47,51].': 23, 'Recently, the significance of susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) in the detection of cerebral microhemorrhage at the early stage has been mentioned to predict the prognosis [52,53].': 25, 'In addition, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) may be also helpful in predicting outcomes in AHT [54].': 16, 'Both CT and MRI can be used to detect brain edema from effacement of the cortical sulci, compression of the

against the virus led to COVID-19 patients achieving serum SARS-CoV-2 RNA negativity after CP transfusion, accompanied by an increase of oxygen saturation and lymphocyte counts, and the improvement of liver function and CRP.': 50, 'Key factors in administering convalescent plasma include concerns that donor plasma must contain an adequate titre of neutralizing antibodies, be administered at the right treatment time point and risk of transmitting potential pathogens must be considered.': 36, 'Mass testing of recovered patients who meet above criteria can provide an efficacious treatment source for COVID- 19 patients [37].': 20, 'Adequate measures to prevent transmission like hand washing, proper PPE, social distancing and use of negative pressure isolation rooms are the backbone in

titers of NAbs after COVID-19 infection, the disease duration of these patients was similar to other patients however it is unclear whether these patients are at a higher risk of rebound or reinfection.': 89, 'Elderly patients were noted to have a higher titre of NAbs with a stronger innate immunity response-clinical co-relation with disease recovery and severity needs to be further
