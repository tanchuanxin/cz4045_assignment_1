{'There was once a widow who had two daughters - one of\nwhom was pretty and industrious, whilst the other was ugly\nand idle.': 24, 'But she was much fonder of the ugly and idle one,\nbecause she was her own daughter.': 17, 'And the other, who was a\nstep-daughter, was obliged to do all the work, and be the\ncinderella of the house.': 21, 'Every day the poor girl had to sit by a\nwell, in the highway, and spin and spin till her fingers bled.': 22, 'Now it happened that one day the shuttle was marked with her\nblood, so she dipped it in the well, to wash the mark off, but it\ndropped out of her hand and fell to the bottom.': 37, 'She began to\nweep, and ran to her step-mother and told her of the mishap.': 15, 'But\nshe scolded her sharply, and was so merciless as to say, since\nyou have let the shuttle fall in, you must fetch it out again.': 26, 'So the girl went back to the well, and did not know what to do.': 15, 'And in the sorrow of her heart she jumped into the well to get the\nshuttle.': 16, 'She lost her senses.': 4, 'And when she awoke and came to\nherself again, she was in a lovely meadow where the sun was\nshining and many thousands of flowers were growing.': 27, "Across this\nmeadow she went, and at last came to a baker's oven full of bread,\nand the bread cried out, oh, take me out.": 25, 'Take me out.': 3, 'Or I shall\nburn.': 4, 'I have been baked a long time.': 7, 'So she went up to it, and\ntook out all the loaves one after another with the bread-shovel.': 18, 'After that she went on till she came to a tree covered with apples,\nwhich called out to her,  oh, shake me.': 22, 'Shake me.': 2, 'We apples are\nall ripe.': 5, 'So she shook the tree till the apples fell like rain,\nand went on shaking till they were all down, and when she had\ngathered them into a heap, she went on her way.': 34, 'At last she came to a little house, out of which an old woman\npeeped.': 15, 'But she had such large teeth that the girl was\nfrightened, and was about to run away.': 17, 'But the old woman called\nout to her, what are you afraid of, dear child.': 15, 'Stay with me.': 3, 'If you will do all the work in the house properly, you shall be\nthe better for it.': 18, 'Only you must take care to make my bed well,\nand shake it thoroughly till the feathers fly - for then there\nis snow on the earth.': 27, 'I am mother holle.': 4, 'As the old woman spoke so kindly to her, the girl took courage\nand agreed to enter her service.': 19, 'She attended to everything to the\nsatisfaction of her mistress, and always shook her bed so vigorously\nthat the feathers flew about like snow-flakes.': 24, 'So she had a\npleasant life with her.': 8, 'Never an angry word.': 4, 'And to eat she had\nboiled or roast meat every day.': 11, 'She stayed some time with mother holle, before she became sad.': 11, 'At first she did not know what was the matter with her, but found\nat length that it was home-sickness.': 20, 'Although she was many thousand\ntimes better off here than at home, still she had a longing to be\nthere.': 20, 'At last she said to the old woman, I have a longing for\nhome, and however well off I am down here, I cannot stay any\nlonger.': 27, 'I must go up again to my own people.': 9, 'Mother holle said,\nI am pleased that you long for your home again, and as you have\nserved me so truly, I myself will take you up again.': 28, 'Thereupon\nshe took her by the hand, and led her to a large door.': 14, 'The door\nwas opened, and just as the maiden was standing beneath the\ndoorway, a heavy shower of golden rain fell, and all the gold clung\nto her, so that she was completely covered over with it.': 37, 'You shall have that because you have been so industrious, said\nmother holle, and at the same time she gave her back the shuttle\nwhich she had let fall into the well.': 32, "Thereupon the door closed,\nand the maiden found herself up above upon the earth, not far\nfrom her mother's house.": 20, 'And as she went into the yard the cock was sitting on the well,\nand cried -\n     cock-a-doodle-doo.': 18, "Your golden girl's come back to you.": 7, 'So she went in to her mother, and as she arrived thus covered with\ngold, she was well received, both by her and her sister.': 25, 'The girl told all that had happened to her, and as soon as the\nmother heard how she had come by so much wealth, she was very\nanxious to obtain the same good luck for the ugly and lazy daughter.': 40, 'She had to seat herself by the well and spin.': 10, 'And in order that\nher shuttle might be stained with blood, she stuck her hand into a\nthorn bush and pricked her finger.': 23, 'Then she threw her shuttle\ninto the well, and jumped in after it.': 13, 'She came, like the other, to the beautiful meadow and walked\nalong the very same path.': 16, 'When she got to the oven the bread again\ncried, oh, take me out.': 14, 'Or I shall burn.': 4, 'I have been\nbaked a long time.': 7, 'But the lazy thing answered, as if I had any\nwish to make myself dirty.': 15, 'And on she went.': 4, 'Soon she came to the\napple-tree, which cried, oh, shake me.': 11, 'We apples are all\nripe.': 5, 'But she answered, I like that.': 6, 'One of you might fall on\nmy head, and so went on.': 12, "When she came to mother holle's house\nshe was not afraid, for she had already heard of her big teeth, and\nshe hired herself to her immediately.": 27, 'The first day she forced herself to work diligently, and obeyed\nmother holle when she told her to do anything, for she was thinking\nof all the gold that she would give her.': 33, 'But on the second day\nshe began to be lazy, and on the third day still more so, and then\nshe would not get up in the morning at all.': 30, "Neither did she make\nmother holle's bed as she ought, and did not shake it so as to\nmake the feathers fly up.": 23, 'Mother holle was soon tired of this, and\ngave her notice to leave.': 13, 'The lazy girl was willing enough to go,\nand thought that now the golden rain would come.': 17, 'Mother holle led\nher also to the great door, but while she was standing beneath it,\ninstead of the gold a big kettleful of pitch was emptied over her.': 29, 'That is the reward for your service, said mother holle, and shut\nthe door.': 14, 'So the lazy girl went home, but she was quite covered with pitch,\nand the cock on the well, as soon as he saw her, cried out -\n     cock-a-doodle-doo.': 29, "Your dirty girl's come back to you.": 7, 'But the pitch clung fast to her, and could not be got off as long\nas she lived.': 18, 'There was once upon a time a fisherman who lived with his wife\nin a pig-stye close by the sea, and every day he went out fishing.': 27, 'And he fished, and he fished.': 6, 'And once he was sitting with his\nrod, looking at the clear water, and he sat and he sat.': 19, 'Then\nhis line suddenly went down, far down below, and when\nhe drew it up again, he brought out a large flounder.': 22, 'Then the\nflounder said to him, hark, you fisherman, I pray you, let me\nlive, I am no flounder really, but an enchanted prince.': 24, 'What\ngood will it do you to kill me.': 9, 'I should not be good to eat, put\nme in the water again, and let me go.': 17, 'Come, said the fisherman,\nthere is no need for so many words about it - a fish that can\ntalk I should certainly let go, anyhow.': 26, 'And with that he put\nhim back again into the clear water, and the flounder went to the\nbottom, leaving a long streak of blood behind him.': 27, 'Then the\nfisherman got up and went home to his wife in the pig-stye.': 14, 'Husband, said the woman, have you caught nothing to-day.': 9, 'No, said\nthe man, I did catch a flounder, who said he was an enchanted\nprince, so I let him go again.': 22, 'Did you not wish for anything\nfirst, said the woman.': 10, 'No, said the man, what should I wish\nfor.': 9, 'Ah, said the woman, it is surely hard to have to live\nalways in this pig-stye which stinks and is so disgusting.': 22, 'You\nmight have wished for a little hut for us.': 10, 'Go back and call\nhim.': 5, 'Tell him we want to have a little hut, he will certainly\ngive us that.': 15, 'Ah, said the man, why should I go there again.': 10, 'Why, said the woman, you did catch him, and you let him go again.': 14, 'He is sure to do it.': 6, 'Go at once.': 3, 'The man still did not quite\nlike to go, but did not like to oppose his wife either, and\nwent to the sea.': 23, 'When he got there the sea was all green and yellow, and no\nlonger so smooth, so he stood still and said,\n          flounder, flounder in the sea,\n          come, I pray thee, here to me.': 34, "For my wife, good ilsabil,\n          wills not as I'd have her will.": 12, 'Then the flounder came swimming to him and said, well what does\nshe want, then.': 15, 'Ah, said the man, I did catch you, and\nmy wife says I really ought to have wished for something.': 20, 'She does not like to live in a pig-stye any longer.': 11, 'She would\nlike to have a hut.': 7, 'Go, then, said the flounder, she has it\nalready.': 9, 'When the man went home, his wife was no longer in the stye,\nbut instead of it there stood a hut, and she was sitting on a\nbench before the door.': 31, 'Then she took him by the hand and said\nto him, just come inside.': 14, "Look, now isn't this a great deal\nbetter.": 8, 'So they went in, and there was a small porch, and a\npretty little parlor and bedroom, and a kitchen and pantry,\nwith the best of furniture, and fitted up with the most\nbeautiful things made of tin and brass, whatsoever was wanted.': 43, 'And behind the hut there was a  small yard, with hens and ducks,\nand a little garden with flowers and fruit.': 21, 'Look, said the\nwife, is not that nice.': 8, 'Yes, said the husband, and so it shall\nremain - now we will live quite contented.': 16, 'We will think about\nthat said the wife.': 8, 'With that they ate something and went to\nbed.': 9, 'Everything went well for a week or a fortnight, and then the\nwoman said, hark you, husband, this hut is far too small for us,\nand the garden and yard are little.': 32, 'The flounder might just as\nwell have given us a larger house.': 12, 'I should like to live in a\ngreat stone castle.': 10, 'Go to the flounder, and tell him to give\nus a castle.': 12, 'Ah, wife, said the man, the hut is quite good\nenough.': 11, 'Why whould we live in a castle.': 7, 'What.': 1, 'Said the\nwoman.': 3, 'Just go there, the flounder can always do that.': 9, 'No,\nwife, said the man, the flounder has just given us the hut,\nI do not like to go back so soon, it might make him angry.': 27, 'Go, said the woman, he can do it quite easily, and will be glad\nto do it.': 17, 'Just you go to him.': 5, "The man's heart grew heavy, and he would not go.": 10, 'He said to\nhimself, it is not right, and yet he went.': 12, 'And when he came\nto the sea the water was quite purple and dark-blue, and grey\nand thick, and no longer so green and yellow, but it was still\nquiet.': 30, 'And he stood there and said,\n          flounder, flounder in the sea,\n          come, I pray thee, here to me.': 18, 'Well, what does she want, now, said the flounder.': 9, 'Alas, said\nthe man, half scared, she wants to live in a great stone castle.': 15, 'Go to it, then, she is standing before the door, said the\nflounder.': 13, 'Then the man went away, intending to go home, but when he\ngot there, he found a great stone palace, and his wife was\njust standing on the steps going in, and she took him by the\nhand and said, come in.': 42, 'So he went in with her, and in the\ncastle was a great hall paved with marble, and many servants,\nwho flung wide the doors.': 25, 'And the walls were all bright with\nbeautiful hangings, and in the rooms were chairs and tables\nof pure gold, and crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling,\nand all the rooms and bedrooms had carpets, and food and wine\nof the very best were standing on all the tables, so that they\nnearly broke down beneath it.': 57, 'Behind the house, too, there\nwas a great court-yard, with stables for horses and cows, and\nthe very best of carriages.': 21, 'There was a magnificent large\ngarden, too, with the most beautiful flowers and fruit-trees,\nand a park quite half a mile long, in which were stags, deer,\nand hares, and everything that could be desired.': 35, "Come, said\nthe woman, isn't that beautiful.": 7, 'Yes, indeed, said the man,\nnow let it be, and we will live in this beautiful castle\nand be content.': 20, 'We will consider about that, said the woman,\nand sleep upon it.': 12, 'Thereupon they went to bed.': 5, 'Next morning the wife awoke first, and it was just daybreak,\nand from her bed she saw the beautiful country lying before\nher.': 23, 'Her husband was still stretching himself, so she poked\nhim in the side with her elbow, and said, get up, husband,\nand just peep out of the window.': 28, "Look you, couldn't we be the\nking over all that land.": 11, 'Go to the flounder, we will be the\nking.': 9, 'Ah, wife, said the man, why should we be king.': 10, 'I\ndo not want to be king.': 7, "Well, said the wife, if you won't be\nking, I will.": 11, 'Go to the flounder, for I will be king.': 9, 'Ah,\nwife, said the man, why do you want to be king.': 12, 'I do not like\nto say that to him.': 9, 'Why not, said the woman.': 5, 'Go to him this\ninstant.': 5, 'I must be king.': 4, 'So the man went, and was quite\nunhappy because his wife wished to be king.': 15, 'It is not right,\nit is not right, thought he.': 10, 'He did not wish to go, but yet\nhe went.': 10, 'And when he came to the sea, it was quite dark-grey, and the\nwater heaved up from below, and smelt putrid.': 21, 'Then he went\nand stood by it, and said,\n\n          flounder, flounder in the sea,\n          come, I pray thee, here to me.': 21, 'Well, what does she want, now.': 6, 'Said the flounder.': 3, 'Alas, said\nthe man, she wants to be king.': 9, 'Go to her.': 3, 'She is king\nalready.': 4, 'So the man went, and when he came to the palace, the castle\nhad become much larger, and had a great tower and magnificent\nornaments, and the sentinel was standing before the door, and\nthere were numbers of soldiers with kettle-drums and trumpets.': 43, 'And\nwhen he went inside the house, everything was of real marble\nand gold, with velvet covers and great golden tassels.': 21, 'Then\nthe doors of the hall were opened, and there was the court in\nall its splendor, and his wife was sitting on a high throne\nof gold and diamonds, with a great crown of gold on her head,\nand a sceptre of pure gold and jewels in her hand, and on\nboth sides of her stood her maids-in-waiting in a row, each\nof them always one head shorter than the last.': 72, 'Then he went and stood before her, and said, ah, wife, and\nnow you are king.': 16, 'Yes, said the woman, now I am king.': 8, 'So\nhe stood and looked at her, and when he had looked at her thus\nfor some time, he said, and now that you are king, let all else\nbe, now we will wish for nothing more.': 37, 'No, husband, said the\nwoman, quite anxiously, I find time passes very heavily, I can\nbear it no longer.': 19, 'Go to the flounder - I am king, but I must\nbe emperor, too.': 14, 'Oh, wife, why do you wish to be emperor.': 9, 'Husband, said she, go to the flounder.': 7, 'I will be emperor.': 4, 'Alas, wife, said the man, he cannot make you emperor.': 10, 'I may not\nsay that to the fish.': 8, 'There is only one emperor in the land.': 8, 'An\nemperor the flounder cannot make you.': 7, 'I assure you he cannot.': 5, 'Said the woman, I am the king, and you are nothing but\nmy husband.': 14, 'Will you go this moment.': 5, 'If he can\nmake a king he can make an emperor.': 11, 'Go\ninstantly.': 2, 'So he was forced to go.': 6, 'As the man went, however, he\nwas troubled in mind, and thought to himself, it will not end\nwell.': 19, 'It will not end well.': 5, 'Emperor is too shameless.': 4, 'The\nflounder will at last be tired out.': 8, 'With that he reached the sea, and the sea was quite black and\nthick, and began to boil up from below, so that it threw up\nbubbles, and such a sharp wind blew over it that it curdled, and\nthe man was afraid.': 43, 'Then he went and stood by it, and said,\n          flounder, flounder in the sea,\n          come, I pray thee, here to me.': 21, 'Alas, flounder,\nsaid he, my wife wants to be emperor.': 10, 'Go to her, said the\nflounder.': 6, 'She is emperor already.': 4, 'So the man went, and when he got there the whole palace was made\nof polished marble with alabaster figures and golden ornaments,\nand soldiers were marching before the door blowing trumpets,\nand beating cymbals and drums.': 37, 'And in the house, barons, and\ncounts, and dukes were going about as servants.': 14, 'Then they opened\nthe doors to him, which were of pure gold.': 12, 'And when he\nentered, there sat his wife on a throne, which was made of one\npiece of gold, and was quite two miles high.': 25, 'And she wore a great\ngolden crown that was three yards high, and set with diamonds and\ncarbuncles, and in one hand she had the sceptre, and in the\nother the imperial orb.': 33, 'And on both sides of her stood the\nyeomen of the guard in two rows, each being smaller than the one\nbefore him, from the biggest giant, who was two miles high, to the\nvery smallest dwarf, just as big as my little finger.': 44, 'And\nbefore it stood a number of princes and dukes.': 10, 'Then the man went and stood among them, and said, wife, are you\nemperor now.': 15, 'Yes, said she, now I am emperor.': 7, 'Then he stood\nand looked at her well, and when he had looked at her thus for\nsome time, he said, ah, wife, be content, now that you are\nemperor.': 30, 'Husband, said she, why are you standing there.': 8, 'Now, I\nam emperor, but I will be pope too.': 10, 'Go to the flounder.': 4, 'Oh,\nwife, said the man, what will you not wish for.': 11, 'You cannot be\npope.': 4, 'There is but one in christendom.': 6, 'He cannot make you pope.': 5, 'Husband, said she, I will be pope.': 7, 'Go immediately, I must be\npope this very day.': 9, 'No, wife, said the man, I do not like to\nsay that to him.': 14, 'That would not do, it is too much.': 8, "The flounder\ncan't make you pope.": 6, 'Husband, said she, what nonsense.': 5, 'If he\ncan make an emperor he can make a pope.': 11, 'Go to him directly.': 4, 'I am emperor, and you are nothing but my husband.': 10, 'Will you go\nat once.': 5, 'Then he was afraid and went, but he was quite faint, and\nshivered and shook, and his knees and legs trembled.': 21, 'And a high\nwind blew over the land, and the clouds flew, and towards evening\nall grew dark, and the leaves fell from the trees, and the water\nrose and roared as if it were boiling, and splashed upon the\nshore.': 41, 'And in the distance he saw ships which were firing guns\nin their sore need, pitching and tossing on the waves.': 21, 'And yet\nin the midst of the sky there was still a small patch of blue,\nthough on every side it was as red as in a heavy storm.': 29, 'So,\nfull of despair, he went and stood in much fear and said,\n          flounder, flounder in the sea,\n          come, I pray thee, here to me.': 25, 'Alas, said the\nman, she wants to be pope.': 9, 'Go to her then, said the flounder,\nshe is pope already.': 11, 'So he went, and when he got there, he saw what seemed to be a\nlarge church surrounded by palaces.': 20, 'He pushed his way through\nthe crowd.': 7, 'Inside, however, everything was lighted up with\nthousands and thousands of candles, and his wife was clad in\ngold, and she was sitting on a much higher throne, and had three\ngreat golden crowns on, and round about her there was much\necclesiastical splendor.': 44, 'And on both sides of her was a row of\ncandles the largest of which was as tall as the very tallest tower,\ndown to the very smallest kitchen candle, and all the emperors\nand kings were on their knees before her, kissing her shoe.': 45, 'Wife, said the man, and looked attentively at her, are you now\npope.': 13, 'Yes, said she, I am pope.': 6, 'So he stood and looked at her,\nand it was just as if he was looking at the bright sun.': 20, 'When he\nhad stood looking at her thus for a short time, he said, ah,\nwife, if you are pope, do let well alone.': 24, 'But she looked as\nstiff as a post, and did not move or show any signs of life.': 18, 'Then said he, wife, now that you are pope, be satisfied, you\ncannot become anything greater now.': 17, 'I will consider about that,\nsaid the woman.': 8, 'Thereupon they both went to bed, but she was\nnot satisfied, and greediness let her have no sleep, for she\nwas continually thinking what there was left for her to be.': 31, 'The man slept well and soundly, for he had run about a great\ndeal during the day.': 17, 'But the woman could not fall asleep at\nall, and flung herself from one side to the other the whole\nnight through, thinking always what more was left for her to\nbe, but unable to call to mind anything else.': 40, 'At length the\nsun began to rise, and when the woman saw the red of dawn,\nshe sat up in bed and looked at it.': 25, 'And when, through the\nwindow, she saw the sun thus rising, she said, cannot I, too,\norder the sun and moon to rise.': 23, 'Husband, she said, poking him\nin the ribs with her elbows, wake up.': 13, 'Go to the flounder, for\nI wish to be even as God is.': 13, 'The man was still half asleep,\nbut he was so horrified that he fell out of bed.': 17, 'He thought\nhe must have heard amiss, and rubbed his eyes, and said, wife,\nwhat are you saying.': 18, "Husband, said she, if I can't order the\nsun and moon to rise, and have to look on and see the sun\nand moon rising, I can't bear it.": 29, 'I shall not know what it is\nto have another happy hour, unless I can make them rise myself.': 19, 'Then she looked at him so terribly that a shudder ran over\nhim, and said, go at once.': 18, 'I wish to be like unto God.': 7, 'Alas,\nwife, said the man, falling on his knees before her, the flounder\ncannot do that.': 16, 'He can make an emperor and a pope.': 8, 'I beseech\nyou, go on as you are, and be pope.': 11, "Then she fell into a\nrage, and her hair flew wildly about her head, she tore open her\nbodice, kicked him with her foot, and screamed, I can't stand\nit, I can't stand it any longer.": 36, 'Will you go this instant.': 5, 'Then he put on his trousers and ran away like a madman.': 12, 'But\noutside a great storm was raging, and blowing so hard that he\ncould scarcely keep his feet.': 18, 'Houses and trees toppled over,\nthe mountains trembled, rocks rolled into the sea, the sky was\npitch black, and it thundered and lightened, and the sea came\nin with black waves as high as church-towers and mountains, and\nall with crests of white foam at the top.': 47, 'Then he cried, but\ncould not hear his own words,\n          flounder, flounder in the sea,\n          come, I pray thee, here to me.': 22, 'Alas, said\nhe, she wants to be like unto God.': 10, 'Go to her, and you will\nfind her back again in the pig-stye.': 13, 'And there they are still\nliving to this day.': 9, 'In olden times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king\nwhose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful\nthat the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever\nit shone in her face.': 40, "Close by the king's castle lay a great dark\nforest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when\nthe day was very warm, the king's child went out into the forest and\nsat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was bored she\ntook a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this\nball was her favorite plaything.": 72, "Now it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball\ndid not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it,\nbut on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water.": 38, "The\nking's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the\nwell was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen.": 25, 'At this\nshe began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be\ncomforted.': 16, 'And as she thus lamented someone said to her, "What ails\nyou, king\'s daughter?': 14, 'You weep so that even a stone would show pity."': 10, 'She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a\nfrog stretching forth its big, ugly head from the water.': 24, '"Ah, old\nwater-splasher, is it you," she said, "I am weeping for my golden ball,\nwhich has fallen into the well."': 21, '"Be quiet, and do not weep," answered\nthe frog, "I can help you, but what will you give me if I bring your\nplaything up again?"': 26, '"Whatever you will have, dear frog," said she, "My\nclothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am\nwearing."': 23, 'The frog answered, "I do not care for your clothes, your\npearls and jewels, nor for your golden crown, but if you will love me\nand let me be your companion and play-fellow, and sit by you at your\nlittle table, and eat off your little golden plate, and drink out of\nyour little cup, and sleep in your little bed - if you will promise\nme this I will go down below, and bring you your golden ball up\nagain."': 81, '"Oh yes," said she, "I promise you all you wish, if you will but bring\nme my ball back again."': 20, 'But she thought, "How the silly frog does\ntalk.': 9, 'All he does is to sit in the water with the other frogs, and\ncroak.': 15, 'He can be no companion to any human being."': 9, 'But the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the\nwater and sank down; and in a short while came swimmming up again\nwith the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass.': 39, "The king's\ndaughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and\npicked it up, and ran away with it.": 21, '"Wait, wait," said the frog.': 5, '"Take\nme with you.': 4, 'I can\'t run as you can."': 6, 'But what did it avail him to\nscream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could.': 18, 'She did\nnot listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was\nforced to go back into his well again.': 25, 'The next day when she had seated herself at table with the king and\nall the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate,\nsomething came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble\nstaircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and\ncried, "Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me."': 59, 'She ran to\nsee who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog\nin front of it.': 21, 'Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat\ndown to dinner again, and was quite frightened.': 18, 'The king saw plainly\nthat her heart was beating violently, and said, "My child, what are\nyou so afraid of?': 20, 'Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to\ncarry you away?"': 12, '"Ah, no," replied she.': 4, '"It is no giant but a disgusting\nfrog."': 8, '"What does a frog want with you?"': 7, '"Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was\nin the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into\nthe water.': 22, 'And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for\nme, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my\ncompanion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his\nwater.': 40, 'And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me."': 13, 'In the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,  "Princess,\nyoungest princess,  open the door for me,  do you not know what you\nsaid to me yesterday by the cool waters of the well.': 35, 'Princess,\nyoungest princess,  open the door for me."': 8, 'Then said the king, "That which you have promised must you perform.': 12, 'Go and let him in."': 5, 'She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped\nin and followed her, step by step, to her chair.': 20, 'There he sat and\ncried, "Lift me up beside you."': 10, 'She delayed, until at last the king\ncommanded her to do it.': 12, 'Once the frog was on the chair he wanted to\nbe on the table, and when he was on the table he said, "Now, push your\nlittle golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together."': 37, 'She did\nthis, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly.': 16, 'The\nfrog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked\nher.': 14, 'At length he said, "I have eaten and am satisfied, now I am\ntired, carry me into your little room and make your little silken bed\nready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep."': 37, "The king's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog\nwhich she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her\npretty, clean little bed.": 33, 'But the king grew angry and said, "He who\nhelped you when you were in trouble ought not afterwards to be\ndespised by you."': 24, 'So she took hold of the frog with two fingers,\ncarried him upstairs, and put him in a corner, but when she was in\nbed he crept to her and said, "I am tired, I want to sleep as well as\nyou, lift me up or I will tell your father."': 51, 'At this she was terribly\nangry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the\nwall.': 20, '"Now, will you be quiet, odious frog," said she.': 9, "But when he\nfell down he was no frog but a king's son with kind and beautiful\neyes.": 18, "He by her father's will was now her dear companion and\nhusband.": 12, 'Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked\nwitch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but\nherself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom.': 36, "Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a\ncarriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white\nostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden\nchains, and behind stood the young king's servant Faithful Henry.": 45, 'Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a\nfrog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart,\nlest it should burst with grief and sadness.': 35, 'The carriage was to\nconduct the young king into his kingdom.': 11, 'Faithful Henry helped them\nboth in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because\nof this deliverance.': 20, "And when they had driven a part of the way the\nking's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken.": 23, 'So he turned round and cried, "Henry, the carriage is breaking."': 11, '"No, master, it is not the carriage.': 7, 'It is a band from my heart,\nwhich was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and\nimprisoned in the well."': 25, "Again and once again while they were on\ntheir way something cracked, and each time the king's son thought the\ncarriage was breaking, but it was only the bands which were springing\nfrom the heart of Faithful Henry because his master was set free and\nwas happy.": 47, 'There was once a peasant who had driven his cow to the fair, and sold\nher for seven talers.': 19, 'On the way home he had to pass a pond, and\nalready from afar he heard the frogs crying, aik, aik, aik, aik.': 23, 'Well, said he to himself, they are talking without rhyme or reason,\nit is seven that I have received, not eight.': 21, 'When he got to the\nwater, he cried to them, stupid animals that you are.': 15, "Don't you know\nbetter than that.": 6, 'It is seven thalers and not eight.': 7, 'The frogs,\nhowever, stuck to their, aik aik, aik, aik.': 10, "Come, then, if you won't\nbelieve it, I can count it out to you.": 14, 'And he took his money out of\nhis pocket and counted out the seven talers, always reckoning four\nand twenty groschen to a taler.': 24, 'The frogs, however, paid no\nattention to his reckoning, but still cried, aik, aik, aik, aik.': 16, 'What, cried the peasant, quite angry, if you know better than I,\ncount it yourselves, and threw all the money at them into the water.': 25, 'He stood still and wanted to wait until they were through and had\nreturned to him what was his, but the frogs maintained their opinion\nand cried continually, aik, aik, aik, aik.': 32, 'And besides that, did not\nthrow the money out again.': 10, 'He still waited a long while until\nevening came on and he was forced to go home.': 17, "Then he abused the\nfrogs and cried, you water-splashers, you thick-heads, you\ngoggle-eyes, you have great mouths and can screech till you hurt\none's ears, but you cannot count seven talers.": 31, "Do you think I'm\ngoing to stand here till you get through.": 12, 'And with that he went\naway, but the frogs still cried, aik, aik, aik, aik, after him till\nhe went home sorely vexed.': 23, 'After a while he bought another cow, which\nhe slaughtered, and he made the calculation that if he sold the meat\nwell he might gain as much as the two cows were worth, and have the\nhide into the bargain.': 40, 'When therefore he got to the town with the\nmeat, a great pack of dogs were gathered together in front of the\ngate, with a large greyhound at the head of them, which jumped at the\nmeat, sniffed at it, and barked, wow, wow, wow.': 45, 'As there was no\nstopping him, the peasant said to him, yes, yes, I know quite well\nthat you are saying wow, wow, wow, because you want some of the meat,\nbut I should be in a fine state if I were to give it to you.': 47, 'The\ndog, however, answered nothing but wow, wow.': 8, 'Will you promise not to\ndevour it all then, and will you go bail for your companions.': 17, 'Wow,\nwow, wow, said the dog.': 6, 'Well, if you insist on it, I will leave it\nfor you, I know you well, and know whom you serve, but this I tell\nyou, I must have my money in three days or else it will go ill with\nyou, you can just bring it out to me.': 50, 'Thereupon he unloaded the meat\nand turned back again.': 9, 'The dogs fell upon it and loudly barked, wow,\nwow.': 10, 'The countryman, who heard them from afar, said to himself, hark,\nnow they all want some, but the big one is responsible to me for it.': 26, 'When three days had passed, the countryman thought, to-night my money\nwill be in my pocket, and was quite delighted.': 20, 'But no one would come\nand pay it.': 8, 'There is no trusting any one now, said he.': 9, 'At last he\nlost patience, and went into the town to the butcher and demanded his\nmoney.': 17, 'The butcher thought it was a joke, but the peasant said,\njesting apart, I will have my money.': 18, 'Did not the big dog bring you\nthe whole of the slaughtered cow three days ago.': 16, 'Then the butcher\ngrew angry, snatched a broomstick and drove him out.': 12, 'Wait, said the\npeasant, there is still some justice in the world, and went to the\nroyal palace and begged for an audience.': 23, 'He was led before the king,\nwho sat there with his daughter, and asked him what injury he had\nsuffered.': 20, 'Alas, said he, the frogs and the dogs have taken from me\nwhat is mine, and the butcher has paid me for it with the stick.': 26, 'And\nhe related at full length what had happened.': 9, "Thereupon the king's\ndaughter began to laugh heartily, and the king said to him, I cannot\ngive you justice in this, but you shall have my daughter to wife for\nit - in her whole life she has never yet laughed as she has just done\nat you, and I have promised her to him who could make her laugh.": 60, 'You\nmay thank God for your good fortune.': 8, 'Oh, answered the peasant, I do\nnot want her at all.': 11, 'I have a wife already, and she is one too many\nfor me, when I go home, it is just as if I had a wife standing in\nevery corner.': 30, 'Then the king grew angry, and said, you are a boor.': 11, 'Ah, lord king, replied the peasant, what can you expect from an ox,\nbut beef.': 15, 'Stop, answered the king, you shall have another reward.': 9, 'Be off now, but come back in three days, and then you shall have five\nhundred counted out in full.': 20, "When the peasant went out by the gate,\nthe sentry said, you have made the king's daughter laugh, so you will\ncertainly receive something good.": 25, 'Yes, that is what I think,\nanswered the peasant, five hundred are to be counted out to me.': 18, 'Listen, said the soldier, give me some of it.': 9, 'What can you do with\nall that money.': 8, 'As it is you, said the peasant, you shall have two\nhundred,  present yourself in three days, time before the king, and\nlet it be paid to you.': 28, 'A Jew, who was standing by and had heard the\nconversation, ran after the peasant, held him by the coat, and said,\noh, wonder of God, what a child of fortune you are.': 33, 'I will change it\nfor you, I will change it for you into small coins, what do you want\nwith the great talers.': 23, 'Jew, said the countryman, three hundred can\nyou still have, give it to me at once in coin, in three days from\nthis, you will be paid for it by the king.': 32, 'The Jew was delighted\nwith the small profit, and brought the sum in bad groschen, three of\nwhich were worth two good ones.': 23, "After three days had passed,\naccording to the king's command, the peasant went before the king.": 16, 'Pull his coat off, said the latter, and he shall have his five\nhundred.': 14, 'Ah, said the peasant, they no longer belong to me, I\npresented two hundred of them to the sentry, and three hundred the\nJew has changed for me, so by right nothing at all belongs to me.': 37, 'In\nthe meantime the soldier and the Jew entered and claimed what they\nhad gained from the peasant, and they received the blows strictly\ncounted out.': 26, 'The soldier bore it patiently and knew already how it\ntasted, but the Jew said sorrowfully, alas, alas, are these the heavy\ntalers.': 23, 'The king could not help laughing at the peasant, and when\nall his anger was spent, he said, as you have already lost your\nreward before it fell to your lot, I will give you compensation.': 36, 'Go\ninto my treasure chamber and get some money for yourself, as much as\nyou will.': 16, 'The peasant did not need to be told twice, and stuffed\ninto his big pockets whatsoever would go in.': 19, 'Afterwards he went to\nan inn and counted out his money.': 11, 'The Jew had crept after him and\nheard how he muttered to himself, that rogue of a king has cheated me\nafter all, why could he not have given me the money himself, and then\nI should have known what I had.': 42, 'How can I tell now if what I have\nhad the luck to put in my pockets is right or not.': 21, 'Good heavens,\nsaid the Jew to himself, that man is speaking disrespectfully of our\nlord the king, I will run and inform, and then I shall get a reward,\nand he will be punished as well.': 36, "When the king heard of the peasant's\nwords he fell into a passion, and commanded the Jew to go and bring\nthe offender to him.": 25, 'The Jew ran to the peasant, you are to go at\nonce to the lord king in the very clothes you have on.': 23, "I know what's\nright better than that, answered the peasant, I shall have a new coat\nmade first.": 18, 'Do you think that a man with so much money in his pocket\nshould go there in his ragged old coat.': 21, "The Jew, as he saw that the\npeasant would not stir without another coat, and as he feared that if\nthe king's anger cooled, he himself would lose his reward, and the\npeasant his punishment, said, I will out of pure friendship lend you\na coat for the short time.": 50, 'What people will not do for love.': 7, "The\npeasant was contented with this, put the Jew's coat on, and went off\nwith him.": 16, 'The king reproached the countryman because of the evil\nspeaking of which the Jew had informed him.': 17, 'Ah, said the peasant,\nwhat a Jew says is always false - no true word ever comes out of his\nmouth.': 21, 'That rascal there is capable of maintaining that I have his\ncoat on.': 13, 'What is that, shrieked the Jew, is the coat not mine.': 11, 'Have\nI not lent it to you out of pure friendship, in order that you might\nappear before the lord king.': 21, 'When the king heard that, he said, the\nJew has assuredly deceived one or the other of us, either myself or\nthe peasant.': 23, 'And again he ordered something to be counted out to him\nin hard thalers.': 14, 'The peasant, however, went home in the good coat,\nwith the good money in his pocket, and said to himself, this time I\nhave made it.': 26, 'Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife\nand his two children.': 16, 'The boy was called Hansel and the\ngirl Gretel.': 9, 'He had little to bite and to break, and once when\ngreat dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily\nbread.': 25, 'Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and\ntossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife, what\nis to become of us.': 30, 'How are we to feed our poor children, when\nwe no longer have anything even for ourselves.': 17, "I'll tell you what,\nhusband, answered the woman, early to-morrow morning we\nwill take the children out into the forest to where it is the\nthickest.": 26, 'There we will light a fire for them, and give each of\nthem one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and\nleave them alone.': 30, 'They will not find the way home again, and we\nshall be rid of them.': 15, 'No, wife, said the man, I will not do that.': 10, 'How can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest.': 12, 'The wild\nanimals would soon come and tear them to pieces.': 11, "O' you fool, said\nshe, then we must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the\nplanks for our coffins, and she left him no peace until he\nconsented.": 32, 'But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the\nsame, said the man.': 15, 'The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and\nhad heard what their step-mother had said to their father.': 23, 'Gretel\nwept bitter tears, and said to Hansel, now all is over with us.': 14, 'Be quiet, Gretel, said Hansel, do not distress yourself, I will soon\nfind a way to help us.': 18, 'And when the old folks had fallen asleep,\nhe got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept\noutside.': 23, 'The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay\nin front of the house glittered like real silver pennies.': 20, 'Hansel\nstooped and stuffed the little pocket of his coat with as many as he\ncould get in.': 18, 'Then he went back and said to Gretel, be comforted,\ndear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us, and\nhe lay down again in his bed.': 30, 'When day dawned, but before the\nsun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying\nget up, you sluggards.': 22, 'We are going into the forest to fetch\nwood.': 9, 'She gave each a little piece of bread, and said, there is\nsomething for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you\nwill get nothing else.': 30, 'Gretel took the bread under her apron, as\nHansel had the pebbles in his pocket.': 15, 'Then they all set out\ntogether on the way to the forest.': 12, 'When they had walked a short\ntime, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so\nagain and again.': 22, 'His father said, Hansel, what are you looking at\nthere and staying behind for.': 14, 'Pay attention, and do not forget how\nto use your legs.': 11, 'Ah, father, said Hansel, I am looking at my\nlittle white cat, which is sitting  up on the roof, and wants to say\ngood-bye to me.': 26, 'The wife said, fool, that is not your little cat,\nthat is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.': 21, 'Hansel,\nhowever, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been\nconstantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket\non the road.': 27, 'When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said,\nnow, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you\nmay not be cold.': 30, 'Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together,\nas high as a little hill.': 12, 'The brushwood was lighted, and when the\nflames were burning very high, the woman said, now, children,\nlay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest\nand cut some wood.': 35, 'When we have done, we will come back and\nfetch you away.': 12, 'Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate\na little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the\nwood-axe they believed that their father was near.': 34, 'It was not the\naxe, however, but a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree\nwhich the wind was blowing backwards and forwards.': 25, 'And as they had\nbeen sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and\nthey fell fast asleep.': 20, 'When at last they awoke, it was already dark\nnight.': 10, 'Gretel began to cry and said, how are we to get out of the\nforest now.': 16, 'But Hansel comforted her and said, just wait a little,\nuntil the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way.': 23, 'And\nwhen the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the\nhand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver\npieces, and showed them the way.': 30, "They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came\nonce more to their father's house.": 18, 'They knocked at the door, and\nwhen the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel,\nshe said, you naughty children, why have you slept so long in the\nforest.': 33, 'We thought you were never coming back at all.': 9, 'The father,\nhowever, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them\nbehind alone.': 17, 'Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout\nthe land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to\ntheir father, everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left,\nand that is the end.': 39, 'The children must go, we will take them\nfarther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out\nagain.': 22, 'There is no other means of saving ourselves.': 8, "The man's\nheart was heavy, and he thought, it would be better for you to share\nthe last mouthful with your children.": 22, 'The woman, however, would\nlisten to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached\nhim.': 17, 'He who says a must say b, likewise, and as he had yielded the\nfirst time, he had to do so a second time also.': 25, 'The children, however, were still awake and had heard the\nconversation.': 11, 'When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up,\nand wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but\nthe woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out.': 37, 'Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said, do not cry,\nGretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.': 22, 'Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of\ntheir beds.': 15, 'Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was\nstill smaller than the time before.': 17, 'On the way into the forest\nHansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a\nmorsel on the ground.': 23, 'Hansel, why do you stop and look round.': 8, 'Said the father, go on.': 5, 'I am looking back at my little pigeon\nwhich is sitting on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me,\nanswered Hansel.': 23, 'Fool.': 1, 'Said the woman, that is not your little\npigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.': 20, 'Hansel, however, little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path.': 12, 'The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they\nhad never in their lives been before.': 19, 'Then a great fire was again\nmade, and the mother said, just sit there, you children, and when\nyou are tired you may sleep a little.': 26, 'We are going into the forest\nto cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and\nfetch you away.': 24, 'When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of\nbread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way.': 19, 'Then they\nfell asleep and evening passed, but no one came to the poor\nchildren.': 15, 'They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel\ncomforted his little sister and said, just wait, Gretel, until the\nmoon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have\nstrewn about, they will show us our way home again.': 46, 'When the moon\ncame they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands\nof birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all\nup.': 31, 'Hansel said to Gretel, we shall soon find the way, but they did\nnot find it.': 16, 'They walked the whole night and all the next day too\nfrom morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,\nand were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three\nberries, which grew on the ground.': 44, 'And as they were so weary that\ntheir legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree\nand fell asleep.': 23, "It was now three mornings since they had left their father's house.": 12, 'They began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the\nforest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and\nweariness.': 27, 'When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white\nbird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood\nstill and listened to it.': 26, 'And when its song was over, it spread its\nwings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they\nreached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted.': 32, 'And when\nthey approached the little house they saw that it was built of\nbread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear\nsugar.': 27, 'We will set to work on that, said Hansel, and have a good\nmeal.': 14, 'I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat some\nof the window, it will taste sweet.': 21, 'Hansel reached up above, and\nbroke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel\nleant against the window and nibbled at the panes.': 28, 'Then a soft\nvoice cried from the parlor -\n     nibble, nibble, gnaw\n     who is nibbling at my little house.': 19, 'The children answered -\n     the wind, the wind,\n     the heaven-born wind,\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves.': 18, 'Hansel, who\nliked the taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and\nGretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and\nenjoyed herself with it.': 32, 'Suddenly the door opened, and a woman\nas old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, came\ncreeping out.': 20, 'Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that\nthey let fall what they had in their hands.': 17, 'The old woman, however,\nnodded her head, and said, oh, you dear children, who has brought\nyou here.': 18, 'Do come in, and stay with me.': 7, 'No harm shall happen to\nyou.': 6, 'She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little\nhouse.': 14, 'Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes,\nwith sugar, apples, and nuts.': 15, 'Afterwards two pretty little beds\nwere covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down\nin them, and thought they were in heaven.': 25, 'The old woman had only pretended to be so kind.': 10, 'She was in reality\na wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the\nlittle house of bread in order to entice them there.': 28, 'When a child\nfell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that\nwas a feast day with her.': 22, 'Witches have red eyes, and cannot see\nfar, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when\nhuman beings draw near.': 25, 'When Hansel and Gretel came into her\nneighborhood, she laughed with malice, and said mockingly, I have\nthem, they shall not escape me again.': 24, 'Early in the morning before\nthe children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both\nof them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump and rosy\ncheeks, she muttered to herself, that will be a dainty mouthful.': 41, 'Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried\nhim into a little stable, and locked him in behind a grated door.': 22, 'Scream as he might, it would not help him.': 9, 'Then she went to\nGretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried, get up, lazy thing,\nfetch some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is\nin the stable outside, and is to be made fat.': 38, 'When he is fat, I\nwill eat him.': 8, 'Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in\nvain, for she was forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.': 22, 'And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel\ngot nothing but crab-shells.': 16, 'Every morning the woman crept to the\nlittle stable, and cried, Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may\nfeel if you will soon be fat.': 26, "Hansel, however, stretched out a\nlittle bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not\nsee it, and thought it was Hansel's finger, and was astonished that\nthere was no way of fattening him.": 38, 'When four weeks had gone by,\nand Hansel still remained thin, she was seized with impatience and\nwould not wait any longer.': 22, 'Now, then, Gretel, she cried to the\ngirl, stir yourself, and bring some water.': 14, 'Let Hansel be fat or\nlean, to-morrow I will kill him, and cook him.': 14, 'Ah, how the poor\nlittle sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how\nher tears did flow down her cheeks.': 24, 'Dear God, do help us, she\ncried.': 7, 'If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we\nshould at any rate have died together.': 19, "Just keep your noise to\nyourself, said the old woman, it won't help you at all.": 16, 'Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the\ncauldron with the water, and light the fire.': 21, 'We will bake first,\nsaid the old woman, I have already heated the oven, and kneaded\nthe dough.': 18, 'She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which\nflames of fire were already darting.': 16, 'Creep in, said the witch,\nand see if it properly heated, so that we can put the bread in.': 19, 'And once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let\nher bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.': 24, 'But Gretel saw\nwhat she had in mind, and said, I do not know how I am to do it.': 20, 'How do I get in.': 5, 'Silly goose, said the old woman, the door is big\nenough.': 11, 'Just look, I can get in myself, and she crept up and\nthrust her head into the oven.': 18, 'Then Gretel gave her a push that\ndrove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the\nbolt.': 21, 'Oh.': 1, 'Then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran\naway, and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death.': 20, 'Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little\nstable, and cried, Hansel, we are saved.': 17, 'The old witch is dead.': 5, 'Then Hansel sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is\nopened.': 14, 'How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance\nabout and kiss each other.': 15, "And as they had no longer any need to\nfear her, they went into the witch's house, and in every corner\nthere stood chests full of pearls and jewels.": 29, 'These are far better\nthan pebbles.': 6, 'Said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever\ncould be got in, and Gretel said, I, too, will take something home\nwith me, and filled her pinafore full.': 28, "But now we must be off, said\nHansel, that we may get out of the witch's forest.": 17, 'When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great\nstretch of water.': 15, 'We cannot cross, said Hansel, I see no\nfoot-plank, and no bridge.': 12, 'And there is also no ferry, answered\nGretel, but a white duck is swimming there.': 15, 'If I ask her, she\nwill help us over.': 9, 'Then she cried -\n     little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\n     Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee.': 18, "There's never a plank, or bridge in sight,\n     take us across on thy back so white.": 16, 'The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back,\nand told his sister to sit by him.': 20, 'No, replied Gretel, that will be\ntoo heavy for the little duck.': 12, 'She shall take us across, one after\nthe other.': 9, "The good little duck did so, and when they were once\nsafely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to\nbe more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from\nafar their father's house.": 41, "Then they began to run, rushed into the\nparlor, and threw themselves round their father's neck.": 16, 'The man\nhad not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the\nforest.': 17, 'The woman, however, was dead.': 5, 'Gretel emptied her\npinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and\nHansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to\nthem.': 28, 'Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in\nperfect happiness.': 14, 'My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever\ncatches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.': 21, 'A poor man had so many children that he had already asked\neveryone in the world to be godfather, and when still another\nchild was born, no one else was left whom he could invite.': 35, 'He knew not what to do, and, in his perplexity, he lay down\nand fell asleep.': 16, 'Then he dreamt that he was to go outside the\ngate,\nand ask the first person he met to be godfather.': 21, 'When he awoke,\nhe determined to obey his dream, and went outside the gate, and\nasked the first person who came up to him to be godfather.': 27, 'The\nstranger presented him with a little glass of water, and said,\nthis is a wonderful water, with it you can heal the sick, only\nyou must see where death is standing.': 32, "If he is standing by the\npatient's head, give the patient some of the water and he will\nbe healed, but if death is standing by his feet, all trouble\nwill be in vain, for the sick man must die.": 40, 'From this time forth,\nthe man could always say whether a patient could be saved or\nnot, and became famous for his skill, and earned a great deal\nof money.': 30, "Once he was called in to the child of the king, and\nwhen he entered, he saw death standing by the child's head and\ncured it with the water, and he did the same a second time, but\nthe third time death was standing by its feet, and then he knew\nthe child had to die.": 56, 'Once the man thought he would visit the godfather, and tell him\nhow he had succeeded with the water.': 19, 'But when he entered the\nhouse, the strangest things were going on within.': 13, 'On the first\nflight of stairs, the broom and shovel were disputing, and\nknocking each other about violently.': 18, 'He asked them, where does\nthe godfather live.': 8, 'The broom replied, one flight of stairs\nhigher up.': 9, 'When he came to the second flight, he saw a heap of\ndead fingers lying.': 15, 'He asked, where does the godfather live.': 7, 'One of the fingers replied, one flight of stairs higher.': 10, 'On\nthe third flight lay a heap of dead heads, which again directed\nhim to the flight beyond.': 18, 'On the fourth flight, he saw fishes on\nthe fire, which frizzled in pans and baked themselves.': 17, 'They,\ntoo, said, one flight of stairs higher.': 8, 'And when he had\nascended the fifth, he came to the door of a room and peeped\nthrough the keyhole, and there he saw the godfather who had\na pair of long horns.': 33, 'When he opened the door and went in,\nthe godfather got into bed in a great hurry and covered himself\nup.': 21, 'Then said the man, sir godfather, what a strange house-hold\nyou have.': 12, 'When I came to your first flight of stairs, the shovel\nand broom were quarreling, and beating each other violently.': 20, 'How stupid you are, said the godfather.': 7, 'That was the boy\nand the maid talking to each other.': 11, 'But on the second flight I\nsaw dead fingers lying.': 10, 'Oh, how silly you are.': 5, 'Those were some\nroots of scorzonera.': 6, "On the third flight lay a heap of dead\nmen's heads.": 11, 'Foolish man, those were cabbages.': 5, 'On the fourth\nflight I saw fishes in a pan, which were hissing and baking\nthemselves.': 16, 'When he had said that, the fishes came and served\nthemselves up.': 12, 'And when I got to the fifth flight, I peeped\nthrough the keyhole of a door, and there, godfather, I saw\nyou and you had long, long horns.': 28, 'Oh, that is not true.': 5, 'The\nman became alarmed, and ran out, and if he had not, who knows\nwhat the godfather would have done to him.': 22, 'It was the middle of winter, and the snow-flakes were falling like feathers from the sky, and a queen sat at her window working, and her embroidery-frame was of ebony.': 30, 'And as she worked, gazing at times out on the snow, she pricked her finger, and there fell from it three drops of blood on the snow.': 27, 'And when she saw how bright and red it looked, she said to herself, "Oh that I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as the wood of the embroidery frame!"': 38, 'Not very long after she had a daughter, with a skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony, and she was named Snow-white.': 31, 'And when she was born the queen died.': 8, 'After a year had gone by the king took another wife, a beautiful woman, but proud and overbearing, and she could not bear to be surpassed in beauty by any one.': 31, 'She had a magic looking-glass, and she used to stand before it, and look in it, and say,\n\n"Looking-glass upon the wall,\nWho is fairest of us all?"': 28, 'And the looking-glass would answer,\n\n"You are fairest of them all."': 11, 'And she was contented, for she knew that the looking-glass spoke the truth.': 13, 'Now, Snow-white was growing prettier and prettier, and when she was seven years old she was as beautiful as day, far more so than the queen herself.': 27, 'So one day when the queen went to her mirror and said,\n\n"Looking-glass upon the wall,\nWho is fairest of us all?"': 22, 'It answered,\n\n"Queen, you are full fair, \'tis true,\nBut Snow-white fairer is than you."': 15, 'This gave the queen a great shock, and she became yellow and green with envy, and from that hour her heart turned against Snow-white, and she hated her.': 28, 'And envy and pride like ill weeds grew in her heart higher every day, until she had no peace day or night.': 22, 'At last she sent for a huntsman, and said, "Take the child out into the woods, so that I may set eyes on her no more.': 26, 'You must put her to death, and bring me her heart for a token."': 14, 'The huntsman consented, and led her away; but when he drew his cutlass to pierce Snow-white\'s innocent heart, she began to weep, and to say, "Oh, dear huntsman, do not take my life; I will go away into the wild wood, and never come home again."': 46, 'And as she was so lovely the huntsman had pity on her, and said, "Away with you then, poor child;" for he thought the wild animals would be sure to devour her, and it was as if a stone had been rolled away from his heart when he spared to put her to death.': 54, 'Just at that moment a young wild boar came running by, so he caught and killed it, and taking out its heart, he brought it to the queen for a token.': 31, 'And it was salted and cooked, and the wicked woman ate it up, thinking that there was an end of Snow-white.': 21, 'Now, when the poor child found herself quite alone in the wild woods, she felt full of terror, even of the very leaves on the trees, and she did not know what to do for fright.': 36, 'Then she began to run over the sharp stones and through the thorn bushes, and the wild beasts after her, but they did her no harm.': 26, 'She ran as long as her feet would carry her; and when the evening drew near she came to a little house, and she went inside to rest.': 28, 'Everything there was very small, but as pretty and clean as possible.': 12, 'There stood the little table ready laid, and covered with a white cloth, and seven little plates, and seven knives and forks, and drinking-cups.': 24, 'By the wall stood seven little beds, side by side, covered with clean white quilts.': 15, 'Snow-white, being very hungry and thirsty, ate from each plate a little porridge and bread, and drank out of each little cup a drop of wine, so as not to finish up one portion alone.': 35, 'After that she felt so tired that she lay down on one of the beds, but it did not seem to suit her; one was too long, another too short, but at last the seventh was quite right; and so she lay down upon it, committed herself to heaven, and fell asleep.': 52, 'When it was quite dark, the masters of the house came home.': 12, 'They were seven dwarfs, whose occupation was to dig underground among the mountains.': 13, 'When they had lighted their seven candles, and it was quite light in the little house, they saw that some one must have been in, as everything was not in the same order in which they left it.': 38, 'The first said, "Who has been sitting in my little chair?"': 11, 'The second said, "Who has been eating from my little plate?"': 11, 'The third said, "Who has been taking my little loaf?"': 10, 'The fourth said, "Who has been tasting my porridge?"': 9, 'The fifth said, "Who has been using my little fork?"': 10, 'The sixth said, "Who has been cutting with my little knife?"': 11, 'The seventh said, "Who has been drinking from my little cup?"': 11, 'Then the first one, looking round, saw a hollow in his bed, and cried, "Who has been lying on my bed?"': 21, 'And the others came running, and cried, "Some one has been on our beds too!"': 15, 'But when the seventh looked at his bed, he saw little Snow-white lying there asleep.': 15, 'Then he told the others, who came running up, crying out in their astonishment, and holding up their seven little candles to throw a light upon Snow-white.': 27, '"O goodness!': 2, 'O gracious!"': 2, 'cried they, "what beautiful child is this?"': 7, 'and were so full of joy to see her that they did not wake her, but let her sleep on.': 20, 'And the seventh dwarf slept with his comrades, an hour at a time with each, until the night had passed.': 20, 'When it was morning, and Snow-white awoke and saw the seven dwarfs, she was very frightened; but they seemed quite friendly, and asked her what her name was, and she told them; and then they asked how she came to be in their house.': 44, 'And she related to them how her step-mother had wished her to be put to death, and how the huntsman had spared her life, and how she had run the whole day long, until at last she had found their little house.': 42, 'Then the dwarfs said, "If you will keep our house for us, and cook, and wash, and make the beds, and sew and knit, and keep everything tidy and clean, you may stay with us, and you shall lack nothing."': 40, '- "With all my heart," said Snow-white; and so she stayed, and kept the house in good order.': 18, 'In the morning the dwarfs went to the mountain to dig for gold; in the evening they came home, and their supper had to be ready for them.': 28, 'All the day long the maiden was left alone, and the good little dwarfs warned her, saying, "Beware of your step-mother, she will soon know you are here.': 28, 'Let no one into the house."': 6, 'Now the queen, having eaten Snow-white\'s heart, as she supposed, felt quite sure that now she was the first and fairest, and so she came to her mirror, and said,\n\n"Looking-glass upon the wall,\nWho is fairest of us all?"': 40, 'And the glass answered,\n\n"Queen, thou art of beauty rare,\nBut Snow-white living in the glen\nWith the seven little men\nIs a thousand times more fair."': 27, 'Then she was very angry, for the glass always spoke the truth, and she knew that the huntsman must have deceived her, and that Snow-white must still be living.': 29, 'And she thought and thought how she could manage to make an end of her, for as long as she was not the fairest in the land, envy left her no rest.': 32, 'At last she thought of a plan; she painted her face and dressed herself like an old pedlar woman, so that no one would have known her.': 27, 'In this disguise she went across the seven mountains, until she came to the house of the seven little dwarfs, and she knocked at the door and cried, "Fine wares to sell!': 32, 'fine wares to sell!"': 4, 'Snow-white peeped out of the window and cried, "Good-day, good woman, what have you to sell?"': 16, '- "Good wares, fine wares," answered she, "laces of all colours;"and she held up a piece that was woven of variegated silk.': 22, '"I need not be afraid of letting in this good woman," thought Snow-white, and she unbarred the door and bought the pretty lace.': 23, '"What a figure you are, child!"': 6, 'said the old woman, "come and let me lace you properly for once."': 13, "Snow-white, suspecting nothing, stood up before her, and let her lace her with the new lace; but the old woman laced so quick and tight that it took Snow-white's breath away, and she fell down as dead.": 37, '"Now you have done with being the fairest," said the old woman as she hastened away.': 16, 'Not long after that, towards evening, the seven dwarfs came home, and were terrified to see their dear Snow-white lying on the ground, without life or motion; they raised her up, and when they saw how tightly she was laced they cut the lace in two; then she began to draw breath, and little by little she returned to life.': 60, 'When the dwarfs heard what had happened they said, "The old pedlar woman was no other than the wicked queen; you must beware of letting any one in when we are not here!"': 33, 'And when the wicked woman got home she went to her glass and said,\n\n"Looking-glass against the wall,\nWho is fairest of us all?"': 24, 'And it answered as before,\n\n"Queen, thou art of beauty rare,\nBut Snow-white living in the glen\nWith the seven little men\nIs a thousand times more fair."': 28, 'When she heard that she was so struck with surprise that all the blood left her heart, for she knew that Snow-white must still be living.': 26, '"But now," said she, "I will think of something that will be her ruin."': 14, 'And by witchcraft she made a poisoned comb.': 8, 'Then she dressed herself up to look like another different sort of old woman.': 14, 'So she went across the seven mountains and came to the house of the seven dwarfs, and knocked at the door and cried, "Good wares to sell!': 27, 'good wares to sell!"': 4, 'Snow-white looked out and said, "Go away, I must not let anybody in."': 13, '- "But you are not forbidden to look," said the old woman, taking out the poisoned comb and holding it up.': 21, 'It pleased the poor child so much that she was tempted to open the door; and when the bargain was made the old woman said, "Now, for once your hair shall be properly combed."': 34, 'Poor Snow-white, thinking no harm, let the old woman do as she would, but no sooner was the comb put in her hair than the poison began to work, and the poor girl fell down senseless.': 36, '"Now, you paragon of beauty," said the wicked woman, "this is the end of you," and went off.': 18, 'By good luck it was now near evening, and the seven little dwarfs came home.': 15, "When they saw Snow-white lying on the ground as dead, they thought directly that it was the step-mother's doing, and looked about, found the poisoned comb, and no sooner had they drawn it out of her hair than Snow-white came to herself, and related all that had passed.": 48, 'Then they warned her once more to be on her guard, and never again to let any one in at the door.': 22, 'And the queen went home and stood before the looking-glass and said,\n\n"Looking-glass against the wall,\nWho is fairest of us all?"': 22, 'And the looking-glass answered as before,\n\n"Queen, thou art of beauty rare,\nBut Snow-white living in the glen\nWith the seven little men\nIs a thousand times more fair."': 29, 'When she heard the looking-glass speak thus she trembled and shook with anger.': 13, '"Snow-white shall die," cried she, "though it should cost me my own life!"': 13, 'And then she went to a secret lonely chamber, where no one was likely to come, and there she made a poisonous apple.': 23, 'It was beautiful to look upon, being white with red cheeks, so that any one who should see it must long for it, but whoever ate even a little bit of it must die.': 34, 'When the apple was ready she painted her face and clothed herself like a peasant woman, and went across the seven mountains to where the seven dwarfs lived.': 28, 'And when she knocked at the door Snow-white put her head out of the window and said, "I dare not let anybody in; the seven dwarfs told me not."': 29, '- "All right," answered the woman; "I can easily get rid of my apples elsewhere.': 15, 'There, I will give you one."': 6, '- "No," answered Snow-white, "I dare not take anything."': 9, '- "Are you afraid of poison?"': 6, 'said the woman, "look here, I will cut the apple in two pieces; you shall have the red side, I will have the white one."': 25, 'For the apple was so cunningly made, that all the poison was in the rosy half of it.': 18, 'Snow-white longed for the beautiful apple, and as she saw the peasant woman eating a piece of it she could no longer refrain, but stretched out her hand and took the poisoned half.': 33, 'But no sooner had she taken a morsel of it into her mouth than she fell to the earth as dead.': 21, 'And the queen, casting on her a terrible glance, laughed aloud and cried, "As white as snow, as red as blood, as black as ebony!': 25, 'this time the dwarfs will not be able to bring you to life again."': 14, 'And when she went home and asked the looking-glass,\n\n"Looking-glass against the wall,\nWho is fairest of us all?"': 19, 'at last it answered,\n\n"You are the fairest now of all."': 11, 'Then her envious heart had peace, as much as an envious heart can have.': 14, 'The dwarfs, when they came home in the evening, found Snow-white lying on the ground, and there came no breath out of her mouth, and she was dead.': 28, 'They lifted her up, sought if anything poisonous was to be found, cut her laces, combed her hair, washed her with water and wine, but all was of no avail, the poor child was dead, and remained dead.': 38, 'Then they laid her on a bier, and sat all seven of them round it, and wept and lamented three whole days.': 22, 'And then they would have buried her, but that she looked still as if she were living, with her beautiful blooming cheeks.': 22, 'So they said, "We cannot hide her away in the black ground."': 12, "And they had made a coffin of clear glass, so as to be looked into from all sides, and they laid her in it, and wrote in golden letters upon it her name, and that she was a king's daughter.": 40, 'Then they set the coffin out upon the mountain, and one of them always remained by it to watch.': 19, 'And the birds came too, and mourned for Snow-white, first an owl, then a raven, and lastly, a dove.': 19, "Now, for a long while Snow-white lay in the coffin and never changed, but looked as if she were asleep, for she was still as' white as snow, as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony.": 40, "It happened, however, that one day a king's son rode through the wood and up to the dwarfs' house, which was near it.": 23, 'He saw on the mountain the coffin, and beautiful Snow-white within it, and he read what was written in golden letters upon it.': 23, 'Then he said to the dwarfs, "Let me have the coffin, and I will give you whatever you like to ask for it."': 23, 'But the dwarfs told him that they could not part with it for all the gold in the world.': 19, 'But he said, "I beseech you to give it me, for I cannot live without looking upon Snow-white; if you consent I will bring you to great honour, and care for you as if you were my brethren."': 38, "When he so spoke the good little dwarfs had pity upon him and gave him the coffin, and the king's son called his servants and bid them carry it away on their shoulders.": 33, 'Now it happened that as they were going along they stumbled over a bush, and with the shaking the bit of poisoned apple flew out of her throat.': 28, 'It was not long before she opened her eyes, threw up the cover of the coffin, and sat up, alive and well.': 22, '"Oh dear!': 2, 'where am I?"': 3, 'cried she.': 2, 'The king\'s son answered, full of joy, "You are near me," and, relating all that had happened, he said, "I would rather have you than anything in the world; come with me to my father\'s castle and you shall be my bride."': 42, 'And Snow-white was kind, and went with him, and their wedding was held with pomp and great splendour.': 18, 'But Snow-white\'s wicked step-mother was also bidden to the feast, and when she had dressed herself in beautiful clothes she went to her looking-glass and said,\n\n"Looking-glass upon the wall,\nWho is fairest of us all?"': 36, 'The looking-glass answered,\n\n\'\'O Queen, although you are of beauty rare,\nThe young bride is a thousand times more fair."': 20, 'Then she railed and cursed, and was beside herself with disappointment and anger.': 13, 'First she thought she would not go to the wedding; but then she felt she should have no peace until she went and saw the bride.': 26, 'And when she saw her she knew her for Snow-white, and could not stir from the place for anger and terror.': 21, 'For they had ready red-hot iron shoes, in which she had to dance until she fell down dead.': 18, 'There were once upon a time a king and a queen who lived\nhappily together and had twelve children, but they were\nall boys.': 24, 'Then said the king to his wife, if the thirteenth\nchild which you are about to bring into the world, is a girl, the\ntwelve boys shall die, in order that her possessions may be great,\nand that the kingdom may fall to her alone.': 45, 'He even caused twelve\ncoffins to be made, which were already filled with shavings, and\nin each lay a little death pillow, and he had them taken into a\nlocked-up room, and then he gave the queen the key of it, and bade\nher not to speak of this to anyone.': 51, 'The mother, however, now sat and lamented all day long, until\nthe youngest son, who was always with her, and whom she had\nnamed benjamin, from the bible, said to her, dear mother, why\nare you so sad.': 38, 'Dearest child, she answered, I may not tell you.': 9, 'But he let\nher have no rest until she went and unlocked the room, and showed\nhim the twelve coffins ready filled with shavings.': 24, 'Then she said,\nmy dearest benjamin, your father has had these coffins made for\nyou and for your eleven brothers, for if I bring a little girl into\nthe world, you are all to be killed and buried in them.': 40, 'And as she\nwept while she was saying this, the son comforted her and said, weep\nnot, dear mother, we will save ourselves, and go hence.': 26, 'But she\nsaid, go forth into the forest with your eleven brothers, and let\none sit constantly on the highest tree which can be found, and keep\nwatch, looking towards the tower here in the castle.': 36, 'If I give\nbirth to a little son, I will put up a white flag, and then you may\nventure to come back.': 23, 'But if I bear a daughter, I will hoist a red\nflag, and then fly hence as quickly as you are able, and may the\ngood God protect you.': 29, 'And every night I will rise up and pray for\nyou - in winter that you may be able to warm yourself at a fire, and\nin summer that you may not faint away in the heat.': 37, 'After she had blessed her sons therefore, they went forth into\nthe forest.': 13, 'They each kept watch in turn, and sat on the highest\noak and looked towards the tower.': 17, 'When eleven days had passed\nand the turn came to benjamin, he saw that a flag was being raised.': 19, 'It was, however, not the white, but the blood-red flag which\nannounced that they were all to die.': 18, 'When the brothers heard that,\nthey were very angry and said, are we all to suffer death for the\nsake of a girl.': 23, 'We swear that we will avenge ourselves -\nwheresoever we find a girl, her red blood shall flow.': 18, 'Thereupon they went deeper into the forest, and in the midst\nof it, where it was the darkest, they found a little bewitched hut,\nwhich was standing empty.': 28, 'Then said they, here we will dwell,\nand you benjamin, who are the youngest and weakest, you shall\nstay at home and keep house, we others will go out and fetch food.': 32, 'Then they went into the forest and shot hares, wild deer, birds and\npigeons, and whatsoever there was to eat.': 20, 'This they took to\nbenjamin, who had to dress it for them in order that they might\nappease their hunger.': 20, 'They lived together ten years in the little\nhut, and the time did not appear long to them.': 18, 'The little daughter which their mother the queen had given\nbirth to, was now grown up.': 16, 'She was good of heart, and fair of\nface, and had a golden star on her forehead.': 17, "Once, on a great\nwashing, she saw twelve men's shirts among the things, and asked her\nmother, to whom do these twelve shirts belong, for they are far\ntoo small for father.": 32, 'Then the queen answered with a heavy\nheart, dear child, these belong to your twelve brothers.': 16, 'Said the\nmaiden, where are my twelve brothers, I have never yet heard\nof them.': 15, 'She replied, God knows where they are, they are\nwandering about the world.': 13, 'Then she took the maiden and opened\nthe chamber for her, and showed her the twelve coffins with the\nshavings, and the death pillows.': 24, 'These coffins, said she,\nwere destined for your brothers, who went away secretly before you\nwere born, and she related to her how everything had happened.': 26, 'Then said the maiden, dear mother, weep not, I will go and seek\nmy brothers.': 15, 'So she took the twelve shirts and went forth, and straight into\nthe great forest.': 15, 'She walked the whole day, and in the evening she\ncame to the bewitched hut.': 15, 'Then she entered it and found a young\nboy, who asked, from whence do you come, and whither are you\nbound, and was astonished that she was so beautiful, and wore\nroyal garments, and had a star on her forehead.': 40, "And she answered,\nI am a king's daughter, and am seeking my twelve brothers, and\nI will walk as far as the sky is blue until I find them.": 29, 'And she\nshowed him the twelve shirts which belonged to them.': 11, 'Then\nbenjamin saw that she was his sister, and said, I am benjamin, your\nyoungest brother.': 16, 'And she began to weep for joy, and benjamin\nwept also, and they kissed and embraced each other with the\ngreatest love.': 22, 'But after this he said, dear sister, there is still\none difficulty.': 12, 'We have agreed that every maiden whom we meet\nshall die, because we have been obliged to leave our kingdom on\naccount of a girl.': 25, 'Then said she, I will willingly die, if by so\ndoing I can save my twelve brothers.': 17, 'No, answered he, you shall not die.': 7, 'Seat yourself beneath this\ntub until our eleven brothers come, and then I will soon come to\nan agreement with them.': 21, 'She did so, and when it was night the others came from hunting,\nand their dinner was ready.': 18, 'And as they were sitting at table, and\neating, they asked, what news is there.': 15, "Said benjamin, don't\nyou know anything.": 6, 'No, they answered.': 3, 'He continued, you have\nbeen in the forest and I have stayed at home, and yet I know\nmore than you do.': 22, 'Tell us then, they cried.': 5, 'He answered, but\npromise me that the first maiden who meets us shall not be killed.': 16, 'Yes, they all cried, she shall have mercy, only do tell us.': 12, "Then said he, our sister is here, and he lifted up the tub, and\nthe king's daughter came forth in her royal garments with the\ngolden star on her forehead, and she was beautiful, delicate and\nfair.": 37, 'Then they were all rejoiced, and fell on her neck, and kissed\nand loved her with all their hearts.': 19, 'Now she stayed at home with benjamin and helped him with\nthe work.': 13, 'The eleven went into the forest and caught game, and\ndeer, and birds, and wood-pigeons that they might have food, and\nthe little sister and benjamin took care to make it ready for them.': 34, 'She sought for the wood for cooking and herbs for vegetables, and\nput the pans on the fire so that the dinner was always ready when\nthe eleven came.': 29, 'She likewise kept order in the little house, and\nput beautifully white clean coverings on the little beds and the\nbrothers were always contented and lived in great harmony with her.': 31, 'Once upon a time the two at home had prepared a wonderful\nfeast, and when they were all together, they sat down and ate and\ndrank and were full of gladness.': 31, 'There was, however, a little\ngarden belonging to the bewitched house wherein stood twelve lily\nflowers, which are likewise called student-lilies.': 21, 'She wished to\ngive her brothers pleasure, and plucked the twelve flowers, and\nthought she would present each brother with one while at dinner.': 24, 'But at the self-same moment that she plucked the flowers the twelve\nbrothers were changed into twelve ravens, and flew away over the\nforest, and the house and garden vanished likewise.': 31, 'And now the\npoor maiden was alone in the wild forest, and when she looked\naround, an old woman was standing near her who said, my child,\nwhat have you done.': 31, 'Why did you not leave the twelve white\nflowers growing.': 10, 'They were your brothers, who are now forevermore\nchanged into ravens.': 11, 'The maiden said, weeping, is there no way of\nsaving them.': 11, 'No, said the woman, there is but one in the whole world, and\nthat is so hard that you will not save them by it, for you must be\ndumb for seven years, and may not speak or laugh, and if you speak\none single word, and only an hour of the seven years is wanting, all\nis in vain, and your brothers will be killed by the one word.': 70, 'Then said the maiden in her heart, I know with certainty that\nI shall set my brothers free, and went and sought a high tree and\nseated herself in it and spun, and neither spoke nor laughed.': 37, 'Now\nit so happened that a king was hunting in the forest, who had a\ngreat greyhound which ran to the tree on which the maiden was\nsitting, and sprang about it, whining, and barking at her.': 37, "Then\nthe king came by and saw the beautiful king's daughter with the\ngolden star on her brow, and was so charmed with her beauty that\nhe called to ask her if she would be his wife.": 37, 'She made no answer,\nbut nodded a little with her head.': 11, 'So he climbed up the tree\nhimself, carried her down, placed her on his horse, and bore her\nhome.': 19, 'Then the wedding was solemnized with great magnificence and\nrejoicing, but the bride neither spoke nor smiled.': 17, "When they had\nlived happily together for a few years, the king's mother, who was\na wicked woman, began to slander the young queen, and said to\nthe king, this is a common beggar girl whom you have brought\nback with you.": 42, 'Who knows what wicked tricks she practises secretly.': 8, 'Even if she be dumb, and not able to speak, she still might\nlaugh for once.': 16, 'But those who do not laugh have bad consciences.': 9, 'At first the king would not believe it, but the old woman urged this\nso long, and accused her of so many evil things, that at last the\nking let himself be persuaded and sentenced her to death.': 38, 'And now a great fire was lighted in the courtyard in which she\nwas to be burnt, and the king stood above at the window and\nlooked on with tearful eyes, because he still loved her so much.': 38, 'And when she was bound fast to the stake, and the fire was licking\nat her clothes with its red tongue, the last instant of the seven\nyears expired.': 29, 'Then a whirring sound was heard in the air, and\ntwelve ravens came flying towards the place, and sank downwards, and\nwhen they touched the earth they were her twelve brothers, whom\nshe had saved.': 35, 'They tore the fire asunder, extinguished the flames,\nset their dear sister free, and kissed and embraced her.': 18, 'And now\nas she dared to open her mouth and speak, she told the king why she\nhad been dumb, and had never laughed.': 24, 'The king rejoiced when\nhe heard that she was innocent, and they all lived in great unity\nuntil their death.': 20, 'The wicked step-mother was taken before the\njudge, and put into a barrel filled with boiling oil and venomous\nsnakes, and died an evil death.': 25, 'An aged count once lived in switzerland, who had an only son,\nbut he was stupid, and could learn nothing.': 20, 'Then said the\nfather, hark you, my son, try as I will I can get nothing into\nyour head.': 19, 'You must go from hence, I will give you into the\ncare of a celebrated master, who shall see what he can do\nwith you.': 25, 'The youth was sent into a strange town, and remained a\nwhole year with the master.': 16, 'At the end of this time, he came\nhome again, and his father asked, now, my son, what have you\nlearnt.': 21, 'Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark.': 11, 'Lord have mercy on us, cried the father, is that all you have\nlearnt.': 14, 'I will send you into another town, to another master.': 10, 'The youth was taken thither, and stayed a year with this master\nlikewise.': 13, 'When he came back the father again asked, my son,\nwhat have you learnt.': 14, 'He answered, father, I have learnt what\nthe birds say.': 10, 'Then the father fell into a rage and said, oh,\nyou lost man, you have spent the precious time and learnt nothing,\nare you not ashamed to appear before my eyes.': 31, 'I will send you\nto a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also,\nI will no longer be your father.': 23, 'The youth remained a whole year\nwith the third master also, and when he came home again, and\nhis father inquired, my son, what have you learnt.': 27, 'He\nanswered, dear father, I have this year learnt what the frogs\ncroak.': 13, 'Then the father fell into the most furious anger, sprang\nup, called his people thither, and said, this man is no longer\nmy son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him out into\nthe forest, and kill him.': 41, 'They took him forth, but when they\nshould have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and\nlet him go, and they cut the eyes and the tongue out of a deer\nthat they might carry them to the old man as a token.': 46, "The youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress\nwhere he begged for a night's lodging.": 19, 'Yes, said the lord of\nthe castle, if you will pass the night down there in the old\ntower, go thither, but I warn you, it is at the peril of your\nlife, for it is full of wild dogs, which bark and howl without\nstopping, and at certain hours a man has to be given to them,\nwhom they at once devour.': 63, 'The whole district was in sorrow\nand dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything\nto stop this.': 21, 'The youth, however, was without fear, and said,\njust let me go down to the barking dogs, and give me something\nthat I can throw to them, they will do nothing to harm me.': 34, 'As he himself would have it so, they gave him some food for\nthe wild animals, and led him down to the tower.': 23, 'When he went\ninside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged their tails\nquite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and did\nnot hurt one hair of his head.': 34, 'Next morning, to the astonishment\nof everyone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said\nto the lord of the castle, the dogs have revealed to me, in\ntheir own language, why they dwell there, and bring evil on\nthe land.': 42, 'They are bewitched, and are obliged to watch over a\ngreat treasure which is below in the tower, and they can\nhave no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise learnt,\nfrom their discourse, how that is to be done.': 43, 'Then all who\nheard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would\nadopt him as a son if he accomplished it successfully.': 25, 'He\nwent down again, and as he knew what he had to do, he did it\nthoroughly, and brought a chest full of gold out with him.': 27, 'The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth heard no more, they\nhad disappeared, and the country was freed from the trouble.': 22, 'After some time he took it into his head that he would travel to\nRome.': 15, 'On the way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of\nfrogs were sitting croaking.': 17, 'He listened to them, and when he\nbecame aware of what they were saying, he grew very thoughtful\nand sad.': 20, 'At last he arrived in Rome, where the Pope had just died,\nand there was great doubt among the cardinals as to whom they\nshould appoint as his successor.': 29, 'They at length agreed that\nthe person should be chosen as Pope who should be distinguished\nby some divine and miraculous token.': 22, 'And just as that was decided\non, the young count entered into the church, and suddenly two\nsnow-white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting\nthere.': 27, 'The ecclesiastics recognized therein the token from above,\nand asked him on the spot if he would be Pope.': 19, 'He was undecided,\nand knew not if he were worthy of this, but the doves counselled\nhim to do it, and at length he said yes.': 26, 'Then was he anointed and\nconsecrated, and thus was fulfilled what he had heard from the\nfrogs on his way, which had so affected him, that he was to be\nhis holiness the Pope.': 34, 'Then he had to sing a mass, and did not\nknow one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his\nshoulders, and said it all in his ear.': 31, 'There was once a man who had seven sons, and still he had\nno daughter, however much he wished for one.': 21, 'At length his\nwife again gave him hope of a child, and when it came into\nthe world it was a girl.': 22, 'The joy was great, but the child was\nsickly and small, and had to be privately baptized on account of\nits weakness.': 22, 'The father sent one of the boys in haste to the\nspring to fetch water for the baptism.': 18, 'The other six went with\nhim, and as each of them wanted to be first to fill it, the jug\nfell into the well.': 24, 'There they stood and did not know what to do,\nand none of them dared to go home.': 18, 'As they still did not return,\nthe father grew impatient, and said, they have certainly forgotten\nit while playing some game, the wicked boys.': 24, 'He became afraid that\nthe girl would have to die without being baptized, and in his\nanger cried, I wish the boys were all turned into ravens.': 27, 'Hardly\nwas the word spoken before he heard a whirring of wings over his\nhead, looked up and saw seven coal-black ravens flying away.': 24, 'The parents could not withdraw the curse, and however sad they\nwere at the loss of their seven sons, they still to some extent\ncomforted themselves with their dear little daughter, who soon\ngrew strong and every day became more beautiful.': 41, 'For a long time\nshe did not know that she had had brothers, for her parents were\ncareful not to mention them before her, but one day she\naccidentally heard some people saying of herself, that the girl was\ncertainly beautiful, but that in reality she was to blame for the\nmisfortune which had befallen her seven brothers.': 58, 'Then she was much\ntroubled, and went to her father and mother and asked if it was\ntrue that she had had brothers, and what had become of them.': 29, 'The\nparents now dared keep the secret no longer, but said that what\nhad befallen her brothers was the will of heaven, and that her\nbirth had only been the innocent cause.': 32, 'But the maiden took it to\nheart daily, and thought she must save her brothers.': 15, 'She had no\nrest or peace until she set out secretly, and went forth into the\nwide world to search for her brothers and set them free, let it\ncost what it might.': 33, 'She took nothing with her but a little ring\nbelonging to her parents as a keepsake, a loaf of bread against\nhunger, a little pitcher of water against thirst, and a little\nchair as a provision against weariness.': 38, 'And now she went continually onwards, far, far to the very end of\nthe world.': 15, 'Then she came to the sun, but it was too hot and\nterrible, and devoured little children.': 17, 'Hastily she ran away, and\nran to the moon, but it was far too cold, and also awful and\nmalicious, and when it saw the child, it said, I smell, I smell\nthe flesh of men.': 36, 'At this she ran swiftly away, and came to the\nstars, which were kind and good to her, and each of them sat on its\nown particular little chair.': 29, 'But the morning star arose, and gave\nher the drumstick of a chicken, and said, if you have not that\ndrumstick you can not open the glass mountain, and in the glass\nmountain are your brothers.': 36, 'The maiden took the drumstick, wrapped it carefully in a cloth,\nand went onwards again until she came to the glass mountain.': 22, 'The\ndoor was shut, and she thought she would take out the drumstick.': 13, "But when she undid the cloth, it was empty, and she had lost the\ngood star's present.": 17, 'What was she now to do.': 6, 'She wished to rescue\nher brothers, and had no key to the glass mountain.': 14, 'The good\nsister took a knife, cut off one of her little fingers, put it in\nthe door, and succeeded in opening it.': 23, 'When she had gone inside, a\nlittle dwarf came to meet her, who said, my child, what are you\nlooking for.': 21, 'I am looking for my brothers, the seven ravens, she\nreplied.': 11, 'The dwarf said, the lord ravens are not at home, but if\nyou will wait here until they come, step in.': 21, "Thereupon the little\ndwarf carried the ravens' dinner in, on seven little plates, and\nin seven little glasses, and the little sister ate a morsel from\neach plate, and from each little glass she took a sip, but in the\nlast little glass she dropped the ring which she had brought away\nwith her.": 54, 'Suddenly she heard a whirring of wings and a rushing through\nthe air, and then the little dwarf said, now the lord ravens are\nflying home.': 26, 'Then they came, and wanted to eat and drink, and\nlooked for their little plates and glasses.': 17, 'Then said one after\nthe other, who has eaten something from my plate.': 13, 'Who has drunk\nout of my little glass.': 8, 'It was a human mouth.': 5, 'And when the\nseventh came to the bottom of the glass, the ring rolled against\nhis mouth.': 17, 'Then he looked at it, and saw that it was a ring\nbelonging to his father and mother, and said, God grant that our\nsister may be here, and then we shall be free.': 34, 'When the maiden,\nwho was standing behind the door watching, heard that wish,\nshe came forth, and on this all the ravens were restored to their\nhuman form again.': 29, 'And they embraced and kissed each other,\nand went joyfully home.': 11, "There was once upon a time an old king who was ill and thought to\nhimself 'I am lying on what must be my deathbed.'": 25, "Then said he 'tell\nfaithful John to come to me.'": 10, 'Faithful John was his favorite servant,\nand was so called, because he had for his whole life long been so\ntrue to him.': 23, "When therefore he came beside the bed, the king said to\nhim 'most faithful John, I feel my end approaching, and have no\nanxiety except about my son.": 28, 'He is still of tender age, and cannot\nalways know how to guide himself.': 14, "If you do not promise me to teach\nhim everything that he ought to know, and to be his foster-father, I\ncannot close my eyes in peace.'": 27, "Then answered faithful John 'I will\nnot forsake him, and will serve him with fidelity, even if it should\ncost me my life.'": 23, "At this, the old king said 'now I die in comfort\nand peace.'": 13, "Then he added 'after my death, you shall show him the\nwhole castle - all the chambers, halls, and vaults, and all the\ntreasures which lie therein, but the last chamber in the long\ngallery, in which is the picture of the princess of the golden\ndwelling, shall you not show.": 51, "If he sees that picture, he will fall\nviolently in love with her, and will drop down in a swoon, and go\nthrough great danger for her sake, therefore you must protect him\nfrom that.'": 35, 'And when faithful John had once more given his promise to\nthe old king about this, the king said no more, but laid his head on\nhis pillow, and died.': 30, "When the old king had been carried to his grave, faithful John told\nthe young king all that he had promised his father on his deathbed,\nand said 'this will I assuredly keep, and will be faithful to you as\nI have been faithful to him, even if it should cost me my life.'": 54, "When\nthe mourning was over, faithful John said to him 'it is now time that\nyou should see your inheritance.": 20, "I will show you your father's\npalace.'": 7, 'Then he took him about everywhere, up and down, and let him\nsee all the riches, and the magnificent apartments, only there was\none room which he did not open, that in which hung the dangerous\npicture.': 37, 'The picture, however, was so placed that when the door was\nopened you looked straight on it, and it was so admirably painted\nthat it seemed to breathe and live, and there was nothing more\ncharming or more beautiful in the whole world.': 43, "The young king\nnoticed, however, that faithful John always walked past this one\ndoor, and said 'why do you never open this one for me.'": 25, "'There is\nsomething within it, he replied,  'which would terrify you.'": 11, "But the\nking answered 'I have seen all the palace, and I want to know what is\nin this room also, and he went and tried to break open the door by\nforce.": 33, "Then faithful John held him back and said 'I promised your\nfather before his death that you should not see that which is in this\nchamber, it might bring the greatest misfortune on you and on me.'": 37, "'Ah, no, replied the young king,  'if I do not go in, it will be my\ncertain destruction.": 18, 'I should have no rest day or night until I had\nseen it with my own eyes.': 17, "I shall not leave the place now until you\nhave unlocked the door.'": 13, 'Then faithful John saw that there was no help for it now, and with a\nheavy heart and many sighs, sought out the key from the great bunch.': 28, 'When he opened the door, he went in first, and thought by standing\nbefore him he could hide the portrait so that the king should not see\nit in front of him.': 32, 'But what good was this.': 5, 'The king stood on\ntip-toe and saw it over his shoulder.': 11, 'And when he saw the portrait\nof the maiden, which was so magnificent and shone with gold and\nprecious stones, he fell fainting to the ground.': 26, "Faithful John took\nhim up, carried him to his bed, and sorrowfully thought 'the\nmisfortune has befallen us, Lord God, what will be the end of it.'": 27, 'Then he strengthened him with wine, until he came to himself again.': 12, "The first words the king said were 'ah, the beautiful portrait.": 11, "Whose it it.'": 3, "'That is the princess of the golden dwelling, answered\nfaithful John.": 11, "Then the king continued 'my love for her is so great,\nthat if all the leaves on all the trees were tongues, they could not\ndeclare it.": 27, 'I will give my life to win her.': 8, 'You are my most\nfaithful John, you must help me.': 10, "The faithful servant considered within himself for a long time how to\nset about the matter, for it was difficult even to obtain a sight of\nthe king's daughter.": 29, "At length he thought of a way, and said to the\nking 'everything which she has about her is of gold - tables, chairs,\ndishes, glasses, bowls, and household furniture.": 30, "Among your\ntreasures are five tons of gold, let one of the goldsmiths of the\nkingdom fashion these into all manner of vessels and utensils, into\nall kinds of birds, wild beasts and strange animals, such as may\nplease her, and we will go there with them and try our luck.'": 51, 'The king ordered all the goldsmiths to be brought to him, and they\nhad to work night and day until at last the most splendid things were\nprepared.': 28, 'When everything was stowed on board a ship, faithful John\nput on the dress of a merchant, and the king was forced to do the\nsame in order to make himself quite unrecognizable.': 33, 'Then they sailed\nacross the sea, and sailed on until they came to the town wherein\ndwelt the princess of the golden dwelling.': 23, 'Faithful John bade the king stay behind on the ship, and wait for\nhim.': 14, "'Perhaps I shall bring the princess with me,  said he,\n'therefore see that everything is in order, have the golden vessels\nset out and the whole ship decorated.'": 28, 'Then he gathered together in\nhis apron all kinds of golden things, went on shore and walked\nstraight to the royal palace.': 22, 'When he entered the courtyard of the\npalace, a beautiful girl was standing there by the well with two\ngolden buckets in her hand, drawing water with them.': 28, 'And when she\nwas just turning round to carry away the sparkling water she saw the\nstranger, and asked who he was.': 22, "So he answered 'I am a merchant, and\nopened his apron, and let her look in.": 16, "Then she cried 'oh, what\nbeautiful golden things.'": 8, 'And put her pails down and looked at the\ngolden wares one after the other.': 15, "Then said the girl 'the princess\nmust see these, she has such great pleasure in golden things, that\nshe will buy all you have.'": 24, 'She took him by the hand and led him\nupstairs, for she was the waiting-maid.': 15, "When the king's daughter saw\nthe wares, she was quite delighted and said 'they are so beautifully\nworked, that I will buy them all from you.'": 26, "But faithful John said 'I\nam only the servant of a rich merchant.": 13, 'The things I have here are\nnot to be compared with those my master has in his ship.': 18, "They are\nthe most beautiful and valuable things that have ever been made in\ngold.'": 15, "When she wanted to have everything brought up to her, he said\n'there are so many of them that it would take a great many days to do\nthat, and so many rooms would be required to exhibit them, that your\nhouse is not big enough.'": 46, "Then her curiosity and longing were still\nmore excited, until at last she said 'conduct me to the ship, I will\ngo there myself, and behold the treasures of your master.'": 31, 'At this\nfaithful John was quite delighted, and led her to the ship, and when\nthe king saw her, he perceived that her beauty was even greater than\nthe picture had represented it to be, and thought no other than that\nhis heart would burst in twain.': 47, 'Then she boarded the ship, and the\nking led her within.': 11, "Faithful John, however, remained with the\nhelmsman, and ordered the ship to be pushed off, saying 'set all\nsail, till it fly like a bird in the air.'": 28, 'Within, the king showed\nher the golden vessels, every one of them, also the wild beasts and\nstrange animals.': 19, 'Many hours went by whilst she was seeing\neverything, and in her delight she did not observe that the ship was\nsailing away.': 23, 'After she had looked at the last, she thanked the\nmerchant and wanted to go home, but when she came to the side of the\nship, she saw that it was on the high seas far from land, and\nhurrying onwards with all sail set.': 45, "'Ah,  cried she in her alarm, 'I\nam betrayed.": 9, "I am carried away and have fallen into the power of a\nmerchant - I would rather die.'": 18, "The king, however, seized her hand,\nand said 'I am not a merchant.": 13, 'I am a king, and of no meaner origin\nthan you are, and if I have carried you away with subtlety, that has\ncome to pass because of my exceeding great love for you.': 34, "The first\ntime that I looked on your portrait, I fell fainting to the ground.'": 15, 'When the princess of the golden dwelling heard this, she was\ncomforted, and her heart was drawn to him, so that she willingly\nconsented to be his wife.': 28, 'It so happened, while they were sailing\nonwards over the deep sea, that faithful John, who was sitting on the\nfore part of the vessel, making music, saw three ravens in the air,\nwhich came flying towards them.': 38, 'At this he stopped playing and\nlistened to what they were saying to each other, for that he well\nunderstood.': 20, "One cried 'oh, there he is carrying home the princess of\nthe golden dwelling.'": 14, "'Yes, replied the second,  'but he has not got\nher yet.'": 11, "Said the third 'but he has got her, she is sitting beside\nhim in the ship.'": 16, "Then the first began again, and cried 'what good\nwill that do him.": 13, "When they reach land a chestnut horse will leap\nforward to meet him, and the prince will want to mount it, but if he\ndoes that, it will run away with him, and rise up into the air, and\nhe will never see his maiden more.'": 46, "Spoke the second 'but is there no\nescape.'": 8, "'Oh, yes, if someone else mounts it swiftly, and takes out\nthe pistol which he will find in its holster, and shoots the horse\ndead, the young king is saved.": 30, 'But who knows that.': 4, "And whosoever\ndoes know it, and tells it to him, will be turned to stone from the\ntoe to the knee.'": 21, "Then said the second 'I know more than that, even\nif the horse be killed, the young king will still not keep his bride.": 24, "When they go into the castle together, a wrought bridal garment will\nbe lying there in a dish, and looking as if it were woven of gold and\nsilver,  it is, however, nothing but sulphur and pitch, and if he put\nit on, it will burn him to the very bone and marrow.'": 53, "Said the third\n'is there no escape at all.'": 9, "'Oh, yes, replied the second,  'if any\none with gloves on seizes the garment and throws it into the fire and\nburns it, the young king will be saved.": 29, 'But what good will that do.': 6, "Whosoever knows it and tells it to him, half his body will become\nstone from the knee to the heart.'": 20, "Then said the third 'I know still\nmore, even if the bridal garment be burnt, the young king will still\nnot have his bride.": 24, 'After the wedding, when the dancing begins and\nthe young queen is dancing, she will suddenly turn pale and fall down\nas if dead, and if some one does not lift her up and draw three drops\nof blood from her right breast and spit them out again, she will die.': 51, "But if any one who knows that were to declare it, he would become\nstone from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot.'": 27, 'When the\nravens had spoken of this together, they flew onwards, and faithful\nJohn had well understood everything, but from that time forth he\nbecame quiet and sad, for if he concealed what he had heard from his\nmaster, the latter would be unfortunate, and if he disclosed it to\nhim, he himself must sacrifice his life.': 57, "At length, however, he said\nto himself 'I will save my master, even if it bring destruction on\nmyself.'": 19, 'When therefore they came to shore, all happened as had been\nforetold by the ravens, and a magnificent chestnut horse sprang\nforward.': 22, "'Good, said the king,  'he shall carry me to my palace,\nand was about to mount it when faithful John got before him, jumped\nquickly on it, drew the pistol out of the holster, and shot the\nhorse.": 38, "Then the other attendants of the king, who were not very fond\nof faithful John, cried 'how shameful to kill the beautiful animal,\nthat was to have carried the king to his palace.'": 33, "But the king said\n'hold your peace and leave him alone, he is my most faithful John.": 17, "Who knows what good may come of this.'": 8, 'They went into the palace, and\nin the hall there stood a dish, and therein lay the bridal garment\nlooking no otherwise than as if it were made of gold and silver.': 32, 'The\nyoung king went towards it and was about to take hold of it, but\nfaithful John pushed him away, seized it with gloves on, carried it\nquickly to the fire and burnt it.': 34, "The other attendants again began\nto murmur, and said 'behold, now he is even burning the king's bridal\ngarment.'": 19, "But the young king said 'who knows what good he may have\ndone, leave him alone, he is my most faithful John.'": 22, 'And now the\nwedding was solemnized - the dance began, and the bride also took\npart in it, then faithful John was watchful and looked into her face,\nand suddenly she turned pale and fell to the ground as if she were\ndead.': 43, 'On this he ran hastily to her, lifted her up and bore her into\na chamber - then he laid her down, and knelt and sucked the three\ndrops of blood from her right breast, and spat them out.': 39, "Immediately\nshe breathed again and recovered herself, but the young king had seen\nthis, and being ignorant why faithful John had done it, was angry and\ncried 'throw him into a dungeon.'": 32, "Next morning faithful John was\ncondemned, and led to the gallows, and when he stood on high, and was\nabout to be executed, he said 'every one who has to die is permitted\nbefore his end to make one last speech, may I too claim the right.'": 47, "'Yes, answered the king,  'it shall be granted unto you.'": 10, "Then said\nfaithful John 'I am unjustly condemned, and have always been true to\nyou,  and he related how he had hearkened to the conversation of the\nravens when on the sea, and how he had been obliged to do all these\nthings in order to save his master.": 49, "Then cried the king 'oh, my most\nfaithful John.": 9, "Pardon, pardon - bring him down.'": 6, 'But as faithful\nJohn spoke the last word he had fallen down lifeless and become a\nstone.': 17, "Thereupon the king and the queen suffered great anguish, and the king\nsaid 'ah, how ill I have requited great fidelity.'": 21, 'And ordered the\nstone figure to be taken up and placed in his bedroom beside his bed.': 17, "And as often as he looked on it he wept and said 'ah, if I could\nbring you to life again, my most faithful John.'": 25, 'Some time passed and the queen bore twins, two sons who grew fast and\nwere her delight.': 17, "Once when the queen was at church and the father\nwas sitting with his two children playing beside him, he looked at\nthe stone figure again, sighed, and full of grief he said 'ah, if I\ncould but bring you to life again, my most faithful John.'": 47, "Then the\nstone began to speak and said 'you can bring me to life again if you\nwill use for that purpose what is dearest to you.'": 27, "Then cried the\nking 'I will give everything I have in the world for you.'": 15, "The stone\ncontinued 'if you will cut off the heads of your two children with\nyour own hand, and sprinkle me with their blood, I shall be restored\nto life.'": 30, "The king was terrified when he heard that he himself must kill his\ndearest children, but he thought of faithful John's great fidelity,\nand how he had died for him, drew his sword, and with his own hand\ncut off the children's heads.": 43, 'And when he had smeared the stone with\ntheir blood, life returned to it, and faithful John stood once more\nsafe and healthy before him.': 25, "He said to the king 'your truth shall\nnot go unrewarded, and took the heads of the children, put them on\nagain, and rubbed the wounds with their blood, at which they became\nwhole again immediately, and jumped about, and went on playing as if\nnothing had happened.": 48, 'Then the king was full of joy, and when he saw\nthe queen coming he hid faithful John and the two children in a great\ncupboard.': 26, "When she entered, he said to her 'have you been praying in\nthe church.'": 14, "'Yes, answered she, 'but I have constantly been thinking\nof faithful John and what misfortune has befallen him through us.'": 20, "Then said he 'dear wife, we can give him his life again, but it will\ncost us our two little sons, whom we must sacrifice.'": 25, "The queen\nturned pale, and her heart was full of terror, but she said 'we owe\nit to him, for his great fidelity.'": 23, "Then the king was rejoiced that\nshe thought as he had thought, and went and opened the cupboard, and\nbrought forth faithful John and the children, and said 'God be\npraised, he is delivered, and we have our little sons again also,\nand told her how everything had occurred.": 49, 'Then they dwelt together\nin much happiness until their death.': 10, 'There was once a miller who was poor, but he had one beautiful daughter.': 14, 'It happened one day that he came to speak with the king, and, to give himself consequence, he told him that he had a daughter who could spin gold out of straw.': 32, 'The king said to the miller: "That is an art that pleases me well; if thy daughter is as clever as you say, bring her to my castle to-morrow, that I may put her to the proof."': 37, 'When the girl was brought to him, he led her into a room that was quite full of straw, and gave her a wheel and spindle, and said: "Now set to work, and if by the early morning thou hast not spun this straw to gold thou shalt die."': 49, 'And he shut the door himself, and left her there alone.': 11, "And so the poor miller's daughter was left there sitting, and could not think what to do for her life: she had no notion how to set to work to spin gold from straw, and her distress grew so great that she began to weep.": 45, 'Then all at once the door opened, and in came a little man, who said: "Good evening, miller\'s daughter; why are you crying?"': 23, '"Oh!"': 1, 'answered the girl, "I have got to spin gold out of straw, and I don\'t understand the business."': 18, 'Then the little man said: "What will you give me if I spin it for you?"': 16, '- "My necklace," said the girl.': 6, 'The little man took the necklace, seated himself before the wheel, and whirr, whirr, whirr!': 15, 'three times round and the bobbin was full; then he took up another, and whirr, whirr, whirr!': 17, 'three times round, and that was full; and so he went on till the morning, when all the straw had been spun, and all the bobbins were full of gold.': 30, 'At sunrise came the king, and when he saw the gold he was astonished and very much rejoiced, for he was very avaricious.': 23, "He had the miller's daughter taken into another room filled with straw, much bigger than the last, and told her that as she valued her life she must spin it all in one night.": 34, 'The girl did not know what to do, so she began to cry, and then the door opened, and the little man appeared and said: "What will you give me if I spin all this straw into gold?"': 38, '"The ring from my finger," answered the girl.': 8, 'So the little man took the ring, and began again to send the wheel whirring round, and by the next morning all the straw was spun into glistening gold.': 29, 'The king was rejoiced beyond measure at the sight, but as he could never have enough of gold, he had the miller\'s daughter taken into a still larger room full of straw, and said: "This, too, must be spun in one night, and if you accomplish it you shall be my wife."': 52, 'For he thought: "Although she is but a miller\'s daughter, I am not likely to find any one richer in the whole world."': 23, 'As soon as the girl was left alone, the little man appeared for the third time and said: "What will you give me if I spin the straw for you this time?"': 32, '- "I have nothing left to give," answered the girl.': 10, '"Then you must promise me the first child you have after you are queen," said the little man.': 18, '"But who knows whether that will happen?"': 7, 'thought the girl; but as she did not know what else to do in her necessity, she promised the little man what he desired, upon which he began to spin, until all the straw was gold.': 36, "And when in the morning the king came and found all done according to his wish, he caused the wedding to be held at once, and the miller's pretty daughter became a queen.": 33, 'In a year\'s time she brought a fine child into the world, and thought no more of the little man; but one day he came suddenly into her room, and said: "Now give me what you promised me."': 38, 'The queen was terrified greatly, and offered the little man all the riches of the kingdom if he would only leave the child; but the little man said: "No, I would rather have something living than all the treasures of the world."': 42, 'Then the queen began to lament and to weep, so that the little man had pity upon her.': 18, '"I will give you three days," said he, "and if at the end of that time you cannot tell my name, you must give up the child to me."': 29, 'Then the queen spent the whole night in thinking over all the names that she had ever heard, and sent a messenger through the land to ask far and wide for all the names that could be found.': 38, 'And when the little man came next day, (beginning with Caspar, Melchior, Balthazar) she repeated all she knew, and went through the whole list, but after each the little man said: "That is not my name."': 36, 'The second day the queen sent to inquire of all the neighbours what the servants were called, and told the little man all the most unusual and singular names, saying: "Perhaps you are called Roast-ribs, or Sheepshanks, or Spindleshanks?"': 39, 'But he answered nothing but: "That is not my name."': 10, 'The third day the messenger came back again, and said: "I have not been able to find one single new name; but as I passed through the woods I came to a high hill, and near it was a little house, and before the house burned a fire, and round the fire danced a comical little man, and he hopped on one leg and cried:\n"Today do I bake,\ntomorrow I brew,\nThe day after that the queen\'s child comes in;\nAnd oh!': 83, 'I am glad that nobody knew\nThat the name I am called is Rumpelstiltskin!"': 14, 'You cannot think how pleased the queen was to hear that name, and soon afterwards, when the little man walked in and said: "Now, Mrs. Queen, what is my name?"': 30, 'she said at first "Are you called Jack?"': 8, '- "No," answered he.': 4, '"Are you called Harry?"': 4, 'she asked again.': 3, '"No," answered he.': 3, 'And then she said": "Then perhaps your name is Rumpelstiltskin?"': 10, '"The devil told you that!': 5, 'the devil told you that!"': 5, 'cried the little man, and in his anger he stamped with his right foot so hard that it went into the ground above his knee; then he seized his left foot with both his hands in such a fury that he split in two, and there was an end of him.': 51, 'There was once upon a time a princess who was extremely proud.': 12, 'If a\nwooer came she gave him some riddle to guess, and if he could not\nguess it, he was sent contemptuously away.': 23, 'She let it be made known\nalso that whosoever solved her riddle should marry her, let him be\nwho he might.': 21, 'At length, three tailors fell in with each other, the\ntwo eldest of whom thought they had done so many dexterous jobs of\nwork successfully that they could not fail to succeed in this also,\nthe third was a little, useless harum-scarum, who did not even know\nhis trade, but thought he must have some luck in this venture, for\nwhere else was it to come from.': 67, 'Then the two others said to him,\njust stay at home, you cannot do much with your little understanding.': 19, 'The little tailor, however, did not let himself be discouraged, and\nsaid he had set his mind to work on this for once, and he would\nmanage well enough, and he went forth as if the whole world were his.': 40, 'They all three announced themselves to the princess, and said she was\nto propound her riddle to them, and that the right persons were now\ncome, who had understandings so fine that they could be threaded in a\nneedle.': 39, 'Then said the princess, "I have two kinds of hair on my\nhead, of what color is it."': 18, '"If that be all," said the first, "it\nmust be black and white, like the cloth which is called pepper and\nsalt."': 22, 'The princess said, "Wrongly guessed, let the second answer."': 9, 'Then said the second, "If it be not black and white, then it is brown\nand red, like my father\'s sunday coat."': 22, '"Wrongly guessed," said the\nprincess, "let the third give the answer for I see very well he knows\nit for certain."': 21, 'Then the little tailor stepped boldly forth and\nsaid, "The princess has a silver and a golden hair on her head, and\nthose are the two different colors."': 28, 'When the princess heard that, she turned pale and nearly fell down\nwith terror, for the little tailor had guessed her riddle, and she\nhad firmly believed that no man on earth could discover it.': 35, 'When her\ncourage returned she said, "You have not won me yet by that.': 14, 'There\nis still something else that you must do.': 9, 'Below, in the stable is a\nbear with which you shall pass the night, and when I get up in the\nmorning if you are still alive, you shall marry me."': 31, 'She expected,\nhowever, she would thus get rid of the tailor, for the bear had never\nyet left anyone alive who had fallen into his clutches.': 26, 'The little\ntailor did not let himself be frightened away, but was quite\ndelighted, and said, "Boldly ventured is half won."': 21, 'So when the evening came, our little tailor was taken down to the\nbear.': 14, 'The bear was about to set on the little fellow at once, and\ngive him a hearty welcome with his paws.': 21, '"Softly, softly," said the\nlittle tailor, "I will soon make you quiet."': 12, 'Then quite composedly,\nand as if he had no anxiety in the world, he took some nuts out of\nhis pocket, cracked them, and ate the kernels.': 27, 'When the bear saw\nthat, he was seized with a desire to have some nuts too.': 16, 'The tailor\nfelt in his pockets, and reached him a handful, they were, however,\nnot nuts, but pebbles.': 18, 'The bear put them in his mouth, but could get\nnothing out of them, let him bite as he would.': 20, '"Eh," thought he,\n"what a stupid blockhead am I, I cannot even crack a nut."': 15, 'And then\nhe said to the tailor, "Here, crack me the nuts."': 12, '"There, see what a\nstupid fellow you are," said the little tailor, "to have such a great\nmouth, and not be able to crack a small nut."': 27, 'Then he took the pebble\nand nimbly put a nut in his mouth in the place of it, and crack, it\nwas in two.': 24, '"I must try the thing again," said the bear, "when I\nwatch you, I then think I ought to be able to do it too."': 25, 'So the\ntailor once more gave him a pebble, and the bear tried and tried to\nbite into it with all the strength of his body.': 26, 'But even you do not\nbelieve that he managed it.': 10, 'When that was over, the tailor took out a violin from beneath his\ncoat, and played something to himself.': 19, 'When the bear heard the\nmusic, he could not help beginning to dance, and when he had danced a\nwhile, the thing pleased him so well that he said to the little\ntailor, "Listen, is it difficult to fiddle?"': 39, '"Easy enough for a\nchild.': 5, 'Look, with the left hand I lay my fingers on it, and with the\nright I stroke it with the bow, and then it goes merrily, hop sa sa\nvivallalera."': 30, '"So," said the bear, "fiddling is a thing I should like\nto learn too, that I might dance whenever I felt like it.': 23, 'What do\nyou think of that?': 6, 'Will you give me lessons?"': 5, '"With all my heart,"\nsaid the tailor, "if you have a talent for it.': 14, 'But just let me see\nyour claws, they are terribly long, I must cut your nails a little."': 18, 'Then a vise was brought, and the bear put his claws in it, and the\nlittle tailor screwed it tight, and said, "Now wait until I come with\nthe scissors."': 30, 'And he let the bear growl as he liked, and lay down in\nthe corner on a bundle of straw, and fell asleep.': 23, 'When the princess heard the bear growling so fiercely during the\nnight, she believed nothing else but that he was growling for joy,\nand had made an end of the tailor.': 31, 'In the morning she arose careless\nand happy, but when she peeped into the stable, the tailor stood\ngaily before her, and was as healthy as a fish in water.': 30, 'Now she\ncould not say another word against the wedding because she had given\na promise before everyone, and the king ordered a carriage to be\nbrought in which she was to drive to church with the tailor, and\nthere she was to be married.': 45, 'When they had climbed into the carriage, the two other tailors, who\nhad false hearts and envied him his good fortune, went into the\nstable and unscrewed the bear again.': 30, 'The bear in great fury ran\nafter the carriage.': 9, 'The princess heard snorting and growling.': 6, 'She\nwas terrified, and she cried, "Ah, the bear is behind us and wants to\nget you."': 17, 'The tailor was quick and stood on his head, stuck his legs\nout of the window, and cried, "Do you see the vise?': 23, 'If you do not be\noff you shall be put into it again."': 13, 'When the bear saw that, he\nturned round and ran away.': 11, 'The tailor drove quietly to church, and\nthe princess was married to him at once, and he lived with her as\nhappy as a woodlark.': 25, 'Whosoever does not believe this, must pay a\ntaler.': 9, 'A certain miller had little by little fallen into poverty, and\nhad nothing left but his mill and a large apple-tree behind\nit.': 23, 'Once when he had gone into the forest to fetch wood, an\nold man stepped up to him whom he had never seen before, and\nsaid, why do you plague yourself with cutting wood, I will\nmake you rich, if you will promise me what is standing behind\nyour mill.': 50, 'What can that be but my apple-tree, thought the\nmiller, and said, yes, and gave a written promise to the\nstranger.': 21, 'He, however, laughed mockingly and said, when three\nyears have passed, I will come and carry away what belongs to me,\nand then he went.': 25, 'When the miller got home, his wife came to\nmeet him and said, tell me, miller, from whence comes this\nsudden wealth into our house.': 25, 'All at once every box and chest\nwas filled, no one brought it in, and I know not how it\nhappened.': 21, 'He answered, it comes from a stranger who met me in\nthe forest, and promised me great treasure.': 18, "I' in return,\nhave promised him what stands behind the mill - we can very\nwell give him the big apple-tree for it.": 23, 'Ah, husband, said the\nterrified wife, that must have been the devil.': 12, 'He did not mean the\napple-tree, but our daughter, who was standing behind the mill\nsweeping the yard.': 18, "The miller's daughter was a beautiful, pious girl, and lived\nthrough the three years in the fear of God and without sin.": 22, 'When\ntherefore the time was over, and the day came when the evil one\nwas to fetch her, she washed herself clean, and made a circle\nround herself with chalk.': 30, 'The devil appeared quite early, but\nhe could not come near to her.': 13, 'Angrily, he said to the miller,\ntake all water away from her, that she may no longer be able to\nwash herself, for otherwise I have no power over her.': 30, 'The\nmiller was afraid, and did so.': 7, 'The next morning the devil came\nagain, but she had wept on her hands, and they were quite\nclean.': 19, 'Again he could not get near her, and furiously said to\nthe miller, cut her hands off, or else I have no power over\nher.': 25, "The miller was shocked and answered, how could I cut off my\nown child's hands.": 15, 'Then the evil one threatened him and said,\nif you do not do it you are mine, and I will take you yourself.': 23, 'The father became alarmed, and promised to obey him.': 9, 'So he\nwent to the girl and said, my child, if I do not cut off both\nyour hands, the devil will carry me away, and in my terror\nI have promised to do it.': 35, 'Help me in my need, and forgive me\nthe harm I do you.': 13, 'She replied, dear father, do with me what\nyou will, I am your child.': 14, 'Thereupon she laid down both her\nhands, and let them be cut off.': 13, 'The devil came for the third\ntime, but she had wept so long and so much on the stumps, that\nafter all they were quite clean.': 26, 'Then he had to give in, and\nhad lost all right over her.': 13, 'The miller said to her, I have by means of you received such\ngreat wealth that I will keep you most handsomely as long as\nyou live.': 27, 'But she replied, here I cannot stay, I will go forth,\ncompassionate people will give me as much as I require.': 21, 'Thereupon she caused her maimed arms to be bound to her back,\nand by sunrise she set out on her way, and walked the whole day\nuntil night fell.': 29, 'Then she came to a royal garden, and by\nthe shimmering of the moon she saw that trees covered with\nbeautiful fruits grew in\nit, but she could not enter, for it was surrounded by water.': 36, 'And as she had walked the whole day and not eaten one mouthful,\nand hunger tormented her, she thought, ah, if I were but inside,\nthat I might eat of the fruit, else must I die of hunger.': 38, 'Then\nshe knelt down, called on God the Lord, and prayed.': 11, 'And\nsuddenly an angel came towards her, who made a dam in the water,\nso that the moat became dry and she could walk through it.': 26, 'And\nnow she went into the garden and the angel went with her.': 13, 'She\nsaw a tree covered with beautiful pears, but they were all\ncounted.': 13, 'Then she went to them, and to still her hunger, ate\none with her mouth from the tree, but no more.': 21, 'The gardener\nwas watching, but as the angel was standing by, he was afraid\nand thought the maiden was a spirit, and was silent, neither\ndid he dare to cry out, or to speak to the spirit.': 37, 'When she had\neaten the pear, she was satisfied, and went and concealed herself\namong the bushes.': 17, 'The king to whom the garden belonged, came\ndown to it next morning, and counted, and saw that one of the\npears was missing, and asked the gardener what had become of it,\nas it was not lying beneath the tree, but was gone.': 44, 'Then\nanswered the gardener, last night, a spirit came in, who had no\nhands, and ate off one of the pears with its mouth.': 24, 'The king\nsaid, how did the spirit get over the water, and where did it go\nafter it had eaten the pear.': 22, 'The gardener answered, someone\ncame in a snow-white garment from heaven who made a dam, and\nkept back the water, that the spirit might walk through the moat.': 28, 'And as it must have been an angel, I was afraid, and asked\nno questions, and did not cry out.': 20, 'When the spirit had eaten\nthe pear, it went back again.': 11, 'The king said, if it be as you\nsay, I will watch with you to-night.': 15, 'When it grew dark the king came into the garden and brought\na priest with him, who was to speak to the spirit.': 23, 'All three\nseated themselves beneath the tree and watched.': 9, 'At midnight the\nmaiden came creeping out of the thicket, went to the tree, and\nagain ate one pear off it with her mouth, and beside her stood\nthe angel in white garments.': 33, 'Then the priest went out to them\nand said, "Do you come from heaven or from earth?': 17, 'Are you a\nspirit, or a human\nbeing?"': 8, 'She replied, "I am no spirit, but an unhappy mortal\ndeserted by all but God."': 15, 'The king said, "If you are forsaken\nby all the world, yet will I not forsake you."': 17, 'He took her with\nhim into his royal palace, and as she was so beautiful and good,\nhe loved her with all his heart, had silver hands made for her,\nand took her to wife.': 35, 'After a year the king had to go on a journey, so he commended\nhis young queen to the care of his mother and said, if she\nis brought to child-bed take care of her, nurse her well,\nand tell me of it at once in a letter.': 48, 'Then she gave birth to\na fine boy.': 8, 'So the old mother made haste to write and announce\nthe joyful news to him.': 15, 'But the messenger rested by a brook\non the way, and as he was fatigued by the great distance, he\nfell asleep.': 22, 'Then came the devil, who was always seeking to\ninjure the good queen, and exchanged the letter for another, in\nwhich was written that the queen had brought a monster into\nthe world.': 33, 'When the king read the letter he was shocked and\nmuch troubled, but he wrote in answer that they were to take\ngreat care of the queen and nurse her well until his arrival.': 34, 'The messenger went back with the letter, but rested at the\nsame place and again fell asleep.': 17, 'Then came the devil\nonce more, and put a different letter in his pocket, in which\nit was written that they were to put the queen and her child to\ndeath.': 31, 'The old mother was terribly shocked when she received\nthe letter, and could not believe it.': 16, "She wrote back again to\nthe king, but received no other answer, because each time the\ndevil substituted a false letter, and in the last letter it was\nalso written that she was to preserve the queen's tongue and\neyes as a token that she had obeyed.": 47, 'But the old mother wept to think such innocent blood was to\nbe shed, and had a hind brought by night and cut out her tongue\nand eyes, and kept them.': 31, 'Then said she to the queen, "I cannot\nhave you killed as the king commands, but here you may stay\nno longer.': 22, 'Go forth into the wide world with your child, and\nnever come here again."': 14, 'The poor woman tied her child on her back,\nand went away with eyes full of tears.': 17, 'She came into a great wild\nforest, and then she fell on her knees and prayed to God, and the\nangel of the Lord appeared to her and led her to a little house\non which was a sign with the words, here all dwell free.': 46, 'A\nsnow-white maiden came out of the little house and said, welcome,\nlady queen, and conducted her inside.': 18, 'Then she unbound the\nlittle boy from her back, and held him to her breast that he might\nfeed, and laid him in a beautifully-made little bed.': 27, 'Then\nsaid the poor woman, "From whence do you know that I was a queen?"': 15, 'The white maiden answered, "I am an angel sent by God, to watch\nover you and your child."': 18, "The queen stayed seven years in the\nlittle house, and was well cared for, and by God's grace, because\nof her piety, her hands which had been cut off, grew once more.": 32, 'At last the king came home again from his journey, and his first\nwish was to see his wife and the child.': 22, 'Then his aged mother\nbegan to weep and said, "You wicked man, why did you write to me\nthat I was to take those two innocent lives," and she showed him\nthe two letters which the evil one had forged, and then\ncontinued, "I did as you bade me, and she showed the tokens, the\ntongue and eyes."': 58, 'Then the king began to weep for his poor wife\nand his little son so much more bitterly than she was doing,\nthat the aged mother had compassion on him and said, "be at peace,\nshe still lives, I secretly caused a hind to be killed, and\ntook these tokens from it, but I bound the child to your wife\'s\nback and bade her go forth into the wide world, and made her\npromise never to come back here again, because you were so\nangry with her."': 87, 'Then spoke the king, "I will go as far as\nthe sky is blue, and will neither eat nor drink until I have\nfound again my dear wife and my child, if in the meantime they\nhave not been killed, or died of hunger."': 44, 'Thereupon the king traveled about for seven long years, and\nsought her in every cleft of the rocks and in every cave, but\nhe found her not, and thought she had died of want.': 34, 'During the\nwhole time he neither ate nor drank, but God supported him.': 13, 'At\nlength he came into a great forest, and found therein the little\nhouse whose sign was, here all dwell free.': 21, 'Then forth came\nthe white maiden, took him by the hand, led him in, and said,\n"Welcome, lord king," and asked him from whence he came.': 26, 'He\nanswered, "Soon shall I have traveled about for the space of\nseven years, and I seek my wife and her child, but cannot find\nthem."': 26, 'The angel offered him meat and drink, but he did not\ntake anything, and only wished to rest a little.': 20, 'Then he lay\ndown to sleep, and laid a handkerchief over his face.': 13, 'Thereupon the angel went into the chamber where the queen\nsat with her son, whom she usually called Sorrowful, and\nsaid to her, go out with your child, your husband has come.': 32, 'So\nshe went to the place where he lay, and the handkerchief\nfell from his face.': 16, 'Then said she, "Sorrowful, pick up your\nfather\'s handkerchief, and cover his face again."': 14, 'The child picked\nit up, and put it over his face again.': 12, 'The king in his sleep\nheard what passed, and had pleasure in letting the handkerchief\nfall once more.': 18, 'But the child grew impatient, and said,\n"Dear mother, how can I cover my father\'s face when I have no\nfather in this world.': 24, 'I have learnt to say the prayer - Our\nFather, which art in heaven - you have told me that my father\nwas in heaven, and was the good God, and how can I know a wild\nman like this.': 40, 'He is not my father."': 5, 'When the king heard that,\nhe got up, and asked who they were.': 13, 'Then said\nshe, "I am your wife, and that is your son, Sorrowful".': 13, 'And he\nsaw her living hands, and said, "My wife had silver hands."': 13, 'She\nanswered, "The good God has caused my natural hands to grow again,"\nand the angel went into the inner room, and brought the silver\nhands, and showed them to him.': 31, 'Hereupon he knew for a certainty\nthat it was his dear wife and his dear child, and he kissed\nthem, and was glad, and said, "A heavy stone has fallen from off\nmy heart."': 34, "Then the angel of God ate with them once again, and\nafter that they went home to the king's aged mother.": 21, 'There were\ngreat rejoicings everywhere, and the king and queen were married\nagain, and lived contentedly to their happy end.': 20, "There was once a king's son who was seized with a desire to travel\nabout the world, and took no one with him but a faithful servant.": 27, 'One day he came to a great forest, and when darkness overtook him\nhe could find no shelter, and knew not where to pass the night.': 26, 'Then he saw a girl who was going towards a small house, and when\nhe came nearer, he saw that the maiden was young and beautiful.': 26, 'He spoke to her, and said, dear child, can I and my servant find\nshelter for the night in the little house.': 22, 'Oh, yes, said the\ngirl in a sad voice, that you certainly can, but I do not advise\nyou to venture it.': 22, 'Do not go in.': 4, "Why not, asked the king's son.": 6, 'The maiden sighed and said, my step-mother\npractises wicked arts.': 10, 'She is ill-disposed toward strangers.': 5, 'Then he saw very well that he had come to the house of a witch,\nbut as it was dark, and he could not go farther, and also was\nnot afraid, he entered.': 33, 'The old woman was sitting in an armchair\nby the fire, and looked at the stranger with her red eyes.': 20, 'Good\nevening, growled she, and pretended to be quite friendly.': 10, 'Take\na seat and rest yourselves.': 6, 'She fanned the fire on which she was\ncooking something in a small pot.': 14, 'The daughter warned the two to\nbe prudent, to eat nothing, and drink nothing, for the old woman\nbrewed evil drinks.': 21, 'They slept quietly until early morning.': 6, "When\nthey were making ready for their departure, and the king's son was\nalready seated on his horse, the old woman said, stop a moment,\nI will first hand you a parting draught.": 33, "Whilst she fetched\nit, the king's son rode away, and the servant who had to buckle\nhis saddle tight, was the only one present when the wicked witch\ncame with the drink.": 32, 'Take that to your master, said she.': 7, 'But\nat that instant the glass broke and the poison spirted on the\nhorse, and it was so strong that the animal immediately fell down\ndead.': 26, 'The servant ran after his master and told him what had\nhappened, but as he did not want to leave his saddle behind, he\nran back to fetch it.': 29, 'When he came to the dead horse, however,\na raven was already sitting on it devouring it.': 17, 'Who knows\nwhether we shall find anything better to-day, said the servant.': 12, 'So he killed the raven, and took it with him.': 10, 'And now they\njourneyed onwards into the forest the whole day, but could not\nget out of it.': 18, 'By nightfall they found an inn and entered it.': 9, 'The servant gave the raven to the innkeeper to prepare for supper.': 12, 'They had stumbled, however, on a den of murderers, and during\nthe darkness twelve of these came, intending to kill the strangers\nand rob them.': 25, 'But before they set about this work, they sat down\nto supper, and the innkeeper and the witch sat down with them,\nand together they ate a dish of soup in which was cut up the\nflesh of the raven.': 40, 'Hardly had they swallowed a couple of\nmouthfuls, before they all fell down dead, for the raven had\ncommunicated to them the poison from the horse-flesh.': 26, "There\nwas no no one else left in the house but the innkeeper's daughter,\nwho was\nhonest, and had taken no part in their godless deeds.": 26, 'She\nopened all doors to the stranger and showed him the store of\ntreasures.': 14, "But the king's son said she might keep everything, he\nwould have none of it, and rode onwards with his servant.": 21, 'After they had traveled about for a long time, they came to a\ntown in which was a beautiful but proud princess, who had made it\nknown that whosoever should set her a riddle which she could\nnot guess, that man should be her husband.': 45, 'But if she guessed\nit, his head must be cut off.': 11, 'She had three days to guess it\nin, but was so clever that she always found the answer to the\nriddle given her before the appointed time.': 27, "Nine suitors had\nalready perished in this manner, when the king's son arrived, and\nblinded by her great beauty, was willing to stake his life for\nit.": 27, 'Then he went to her and laid his riddle before her.': 11, 'What\nis this, said he.': 5, 'One slew none, and yet slew twelve.': 7, 'She\ndid not know what that was.': 7, 'She thought and thought, but she\ncould not solve it.': 10, 'She opened her riddle-books, but it was\nnot in them - in short, her wisdom was at an end.': 19, "As she\ndid not know how to help herself, she ordered her maid to\ncreep into the lord's sleeping-chamber, and listen to his\ndreams, and thought that he would perhaps speak in his sleep\nand reveal the riddle.": 38, 'But the clever servant had placed\nhimself in the bed instead of his master, and when the maid\ncame there, he tore off from her the mantle in which she had\nwrapped herself, and chased her out with rods.': 39, "The second night\nthe king's daughter sent her maid-in-waiting, who was to see\nif she could succeed better in listening, but the servant\ntook her mantle also away from her, and hunted her out with\nrods.": 36, 'Now the master believed himself safe for the third\nnight, and lay down in his own bed.': 17, 'Then came the princess\nherself, and she had put on a misty-grey mantle, and she\nseated herself near him.': 19, 'And when she thought that he was\nasleep and dreaming, she spoke to him, and hoped that he\nwould answer in his sleep, as many do, but he was awake, and\nunderstood and heard everything quite well.': 37, 'Then she asked,\none slew none, what is that.': 9, 'He replied, a raven, which\nate of a dead and poisoned horse, and died of it.': 16, 'She\ninquired further, and yet slew twelve, what is that.': 10, 'He\nanswered, that means twelve murderers, who ate the raven and died\nof it.': 14, 'When she knew the answer to the riddle she wanted to steal\naway, but he held her mantle so fast that she was forced to\nleave it behind her.': 29, "Next morning, the king's daughter\nannounced that she had guessed the riddle, and sent for the\ntwelve judges and expounded it before them.": 23, 'But the youth\nbegged for a hearing, and said, she stole into my room in the\nnight and questioned me, otherwise she could not have\ndiscovered it.': 27, 'The judges said, bring us a proof of this.': 9, "Then were the three mantles brought thither by the servant,\nand when the judges saw the misty-grey one which the king's\ndaughter usually wore, they said, let the mantle be\nembroidered with gold and silver, and then it will be your\nwedding-mantle.": 42, 'There was once a poor peasant who sat in the evening by the\nhearth and poked the fire, and his wife sat and spun.': 24, 'Then\nsaid he, how sad it is that we have no children.': 12, 'With us all\nis so quiet, and in other houses it is noisy and lively.': 15, 'Yes, replied the wife, and sighed, even if we had only one,\nand it were quite small, and only as big as a thumb, I should be\nquite satisfied, and we would still love it with all our hearts.': 39, 'Now it so happened that the woman fell ill, and after seven\nmonths gave birth to a child, that was perfect in all its limbs,\nbut no longer than a thumb.': 31, 'Then said they, it is as we wished\nit to be, and it shall be our dear child.': 18, 'And because of its\nsize, they called it thumbling.': 9, 'Though they did not let it want\nfor food, the child did not grow taller, but remained as it had\nbeen at the first.': 24, 'Nevertheless it looked sensibly out of its\neyes, and soon showed itself to be a wise and nimble creature,\nfor everything it did turned out well.': 26, 'One day the peasant was getting ready to go into the forest to\ncut wood, when he said as if to himself, how I wish that there\nwas someone who would bring the cart to me.': 36, 'Oh father, cried\nthumbling, I will soon bring the cart, rely on that.': 13, 'It shall\nbe in the forest at the appointed time.': 10, 'The man smiled and\nsaid, how can that be done, you are far too small to lead the\nhorse by the reins.': 22, "That's of no consequence, father, if my\nmother will only harness it, I shall sit in the horse's ear\nand call out to him how he is to go.": 29, 'Well, answered the man,\nfor once we will try it.': 10, 'When the time came, the mother harnessed the horse, and placed\nthumbling in its ear, and then the little creature cried, gee\nup, gee up.': 25, 'Then it went quite properly as if with its master, and the cart\nwent the right way into the forest.': 20, 'It so happened that just\nas he was turning a corner, and the little one was crying, gee\nup, two strange men came towards him.': 25, 'My word, said one of them,\nwhat is this.': 9, 'There is a cart coming, and a driver is calling to\nthe horse and still he is not to be seen.': 21, "That can't be right,\nsaid the other, we will follow the cart and see where it stops.": 17, 'The\ncart, however, drove right into the forest, and exactly to the\nplace where the wood had been cut.': 19, 'When thumbling saw his\nfather, he cried to him, do you see, father, here I am with the\ncart, now take me down.': 23, 'The father got hold of the horse with\nhis left hand and with the right took his little son out of the\near.': 23, 'Thumbling sat down quite merrily on a straw, but when the\ntwo strange men\nsaw him, they did not know what to say for\nastonishment.': 25, 'Then one of them took the other aside and said,\nlisten, the little fellow would make our fortune if we exhibited\nhim in a large town, for money.': 28, 'We will buy him.': 4, 'They went to\nthe peasant and said, sell us the little man.': 12, 'He shall be well\ntreated with us.': 7, 'No, replied the father, he is the apple of my\neye, and all the money in the world cannot buy him from me.': 23, "Thumbling, however, when he heard of the bargain, had crept up\nthe folds of his father's coat, placed himself on his shoulder,\nand whispered in his ear, father do give me away, I will soon\ncome back again.": 38, 'Then the father parted with him to the two\nmen for a handsome sum of money.': 16, 'Where will you sit, they\nsaid to him.': 8, 'Oh just set me on the rim of your hat, and then I\ncan walk backwards and forwards and look at the country, and\nstill not fall down.': 28, 'They did as he wished, and when thumbling\nhad taken leave of his father, they went away with him.': 19, 'They\nwalked until it was dusk, and then the little fellow said,\ndo take me down, it is necessary.': 19, 'Just stay up there, said the\nman on whose hat he sat, it makes no difference to me.': 18, 'The birds\nsometimes let things fall on me.': 8, "No, said thumbling, I\nknow what's manners, take me quickly down.": 11, 'The man took his hat\noff, and put the little fellow on the ground by the wayside, and\nhe leapt and crept about a little between the sods, and then he\nsuddenly slipped into a mousehole which he had sought out.': 41, 'Good evening, gentlemen, just go home without me, he cried to\nthem, and mocked them.': 15, 'They ran thither and stuck their sticks\ninto the mousehole, but it was all in vain.': 16, 'Thumbling crept\nstill farther in, and as it soon became quite\ndark, they were forced to go home with their vexation and\ntheir empty purses.': 25, 'When thumbling saw that they were gone, he crept back out of the\nsubterranean passage.': 15, 'It is so dangerous to walk on the ground\nin the dark, said he, how easily a neck or a leg is broken.': 23, 'Fortunately he stumbled against an empty snail-shell.': 7, 'Thank God,\nsaid he, in that I can pass the night in safety.': 13, 'And got into it.': 4, "Not long afterwards, when he was just going to sleep, he heard two\nmen go by, and one of them was saying, how shall we set about\ngetting hold of the rich pastor's silver and gold.": 36, 'I could tell\nyou that, cried thumbling, interrupting them.': 9, 'What was that, said\none of the thieves in fright, I heard someone speaking.': 14, "They stood\nstill listening, and thumbling spoke again, and said, take\nme with you, and I'll help you.": 18, 'But where are you.': 4, 'Just look on the ground, and observe from\nwhence my voice comes, he replied.': 14, 'There the thieves at length\nfound him, and lifted him up.': 11, 'You little imp, how will you help\nus, they said.': 10, "Listen, said he, I will creep into the pastor's\nroom through the iron bars, and will reach out to you whatever\nyou want to have.": 25, 'Come then, they said, and we will see what you\ncan do.': 12, "When they got to the pastor's house, thumbling crept into\nthe room, but instantly cried out with all his might, do you want\nto have everything that is here.": 29, 'The thieves were alarmed, and\nsaid, but do speak softly, so as not to waken any one.': 17, 'Thumbling\nhowever, behaved as if he had not understood this, and cried\nagain, what do you want.': 17, 'Do you want to have everything that is\nhere.': 9, 'The cook, who slept in the next room, heard this and sat up\nin bed, and listened.': 17, 'The thieves, however, had in their fright\nrun some distance away, but at last they took courage, and\nthought, the little rascal wants to mock us.': 26, 'They came back and\nwhispered to him, come be serious, and reach something out to us.': 16, 'Then thumbling again cried as loudly as he could, I really will\ngive you everything, just put your hands in.': 20, 'The maid who was\nlistening, heard this quite distinctly, and jumped out of bed\nand rushed to the door.': 19, 'The thieves took flight, and ran as if\nthe wild huntsman\nwere behind them, but as the maid could not see\nanything, she went to strike a light.': 28, 'When she came to the\nplace with it, thumbling, unperceived, betook himself to the\ngranary, and the maid after she had examined every corner and\nfound nothing, lay down in her bed again, and believed that,\nafter all, she had only been dreaming with open eyes and ears.': 48, 'Thumbling had climbed up among the hay and found a beautiful\nplace to sleep in.': 15, 'There he intended to rest until day, and\nthen go home again to his parents.': 15, 'But there were other things in\nstore for him.': 9, 'Truly, there is much worry and affliction in\nthis world.': 10, 'When the day dawned, the maid arose from her bed to\nfeed the cows.': 14, 'Her first walk was into the barn, where she laid\nhold of an armful of hay, and precisely that very one in which\npoor thumbling was lying asleep.': 28, 'He, however, was sleeping so\nsoundly that he was aware of nothing, and did not awake until he\nwas in the mouth of the cow, who had picked him up with the hay.': 33, 'Ah, heavens, cried he, how have I got into the fulling mill.': 12, 'But\nhe soon discovered where he was.': 7, 'Then he had to take care not to\nlet himself go between the teeth and be dismembered, but he was\nsubsequently forced to slip down into the stomach with the hay.': 31, 'In this little room the windows are forgotten, said he, and no\nsun shines in, neither will a candle be brought.': 21, 'His quarters\nwere especially unpleasing to him, and the worst was that more\nand more hay was always coming in by the door, and the space grew\nless and less.': 30, 'When at length in his anguish, he cried as\nloud as he could, bring me no more fodder, bring me no more\nfodder.': 23, 'The maid was just milking the cow, and when she heard\nsome one speaking, and saw no one, and perceived that it was the\nsame voice that she had heard in the night, she was so\nterrified that she slipped off her stool, and spilt the milk.': 47, 'She ran in great haste to her master, and said, oh heavens,\npastor, the cow has been speaking.': 18, 'You are mad, replied the\npastor, but he went himself to the byre to see what was there.': 18, 'Hardly, however had he set his foot inside when thumbling again\ncried, bring me no more fodder, bring me no more fodder.': 22, 'Then\nthe pastor himself was alarmed, and thought that an evil\nspirit had gone into the cow, and ordered her to be killed.': 23, 'She was\nkilled, but the stomach, in which thumbling was, was thrown on\nthe dunghill.': 15, 'Thumbling had great difficulty in working his\nway out.': 9, 'However, he succeeded so far as to get some room, but\njust as he was going to thrust his head out, a new misfortune\noccurred.': 25, 'A hungry wolf ran thither, and swallowed the whole\nstomach at one gulp.': 13, 'Thumbling did not lose courage.': 5, 'Perhaps,\nthought he, the wolf will listen to what I have got to say.': 14, 'And\nhe called to him from out of his belly, dear wolf, I know of a\nmagnificent feast for you.': 20, 'Where is it to be had, said the wolf.': 9, 'In such and such a house.': 6, 'You must creep into it through the\nkitchen-sink, and will find cakes, and bacon, and sausages, and\nas much of them as you can eat.': 25, "And he described to him exactly\nhis father's house.": 9, "The wolf did not require to be told this\ntwice, squeezed himself in at night through the sink, and ate to\nhis heart's content in the larder.": 27, 'When he had eaten his fill,\nhe wanted to go out again, but he had become so big that he could\nnot go out by the same way.': 28, "Thumbling had reckoned on this, and\nnow began to make a violent noise in the wolf's body, and raged\nand screamed as loudly as he could.": 26, 'Will you be quiet, said the\nwolf, you will waken up the people.': 13, 'What do I care, replied the\nlittle fellow, you have eaten your fill, and I will make merry\nlikewise.': 19, 'And began once more to scream with all his strength.': 10, 'At last his father and mother were aroused by it, and ran to the\nroom and looked in through the opening in the door.': 24, 'When they\nsaw that a wolf was inside, they ran away, and teh husband\nfetched his axe, and the wife the scythe.': 22, 'Stay behind, said the\nman, when they entered the room.': 10, 'When I have given the blow, if\nhe is not killed by it, you must cut him down and hew his body\nto pieces.': 24, "Then thumbling heard his parents, voices and cried,\ndear father, I am here, I am in the wolf's body.": 19, 'Said the father,\nfull of joy, thank God, our dear child has found us again.': 15, 'And\nbade the\nwoman take away her scythe, that thumbling might not be hurt\nwith it.': 16, 'After that he raised his arm, and struck the wolf\nsuch a blow on his head that he fell down\ndead, and then they got knives and scissors and cut his body open\nand drew the little fellow forth.': 39, 'Ah, said the father, what sorrow we have gone through for your\nsake.': 13, 'Yes father, I have gone about the world a great deal.': 11, 'Thank heaven, I breathe fresh air again.': 7, 'Where have you been,\nthen.': 5, "Ah, father, I have been in a mouse's hole, in a cow's\nbelly, and then in a wolf's paunch.": 19, 'Now I will stay with you.': 6, 'And we will not sell you again, no not for all the riches in\nthe world, said his parents, and they embraced and kissed their\ndear thumbling.': 27, 'They gave him to eat and to drink, and had\nsome new clothes made for him, for his own had been spoiled\non his journey.': 25, 'There was once a young fellow who enlisted as a soldier, conducted\nhimself bravely, and was always the foremost when it rained bullets.': 23, 'So long as the war lasted, all went well, but when peace was made, he\nreceived his dismissal, and the captain said he might go where he\nliked.': 28, 'His parents were dead, and he had no longer a home, so he\nwent to his brothers and begged them to take him in, and keep him\nuntil war broke out again.': 32, 'The brothers, however, were hard-hearted\nand said, "What can we do with you?': 13, 'You are of no use to us, go and\nmake a living for yourself."': 14, 'The soldier had nothing left but his\ngun, so he took that on his shoulder, and went forth into the world.': 21, 'He came to a wide heath, on which nothing was to be seen but a circle\nof trees, under these he sat sorrowfully down, and began to think\nover his fate.': 31, "I have no money, thought he, I have learnt no trade\nbut that of fighting, and now that they have made peace they don't\nwant me any longer, so I see before hand that I shall have to starve.": 39, 'All at once he heard a rustling and when he looked round, a strange\nman stood before him, who wore a green coat and looked right stately,\nbut had a hideous cloven foot.': 33, '"I know already what you are in need\nof," said the man, "gold and possessions shall you have, as much as\nyou can make away with, do what you will, but first I must know if\nyou are fearless, that I may not bestow my money in vain."': 48, '"A soldier\nand fear - how can those two things go together?"': 12, 'he answered, "You\ncan put me to the proof."': 9, '"Very well, then," answered the man, "look\nbehind you."': 9, 'The soldier turned round, and saw a large bear, which\ncame growling towards him.': 14, '"Oho," cried the soldier, "I will tickle\nyour nose for you, so that you shall soon lose your fancy for\ngrowling," and he aimed at the bear and shot it through the muzzle,\nit fell down and never stirred again.': 40, '"I see quite well," said the\nstranger, "that you are not wanting in courage, but there is still\nanother condition which you will have to fulfil."': 26, '"If it does not\nendanger my salvation," replied the soldier, who knew very well who\nwas standing by him.': 19, '"If it does, I\'ll have nothing to do with it."': 10, '"You will look to that for yourself," answered greencoat, "you shall\nfor the next seven years neither wash yourself, nor comb your beard,\nnor your hair, nor cut your nails, nor once say the Lord\'s prayer.': 36, 'I\nwill give you a coat and a cloak, which during this time you must\nwear.': 16, 'If you die during these seven years, you are mine, if you\nremain alive, you are free, and rich to boot, for all the rest of\nyour life."': 28, 'The soldier thought of the great extremity in which he\nnow found himself, and as he so often had gone to meet death, he\nresolved to risk it now also, and agreed to the terms.': 35, 'The devil\ntook off his green coat, and gave it to the soldier, and said, "If\nyou have this coat on your back and put your hand into the pocket,\nyou will always find it full of money."': 38, 'Then he pulled the skin off\nthe bear and said, "This shall be your cloak, and your bed also, for\nthereon shall you sleep, and and in no other bed shall you lie, and\nbecause of this apparel shall you be called Bearskin."': 43, 'Whereupon the\ndevil vanished.': 4, 'The soldier put the coat on, felt at once in the pocket, and found\nthat the thing was really true.': 20, 'Then he put on the bearskin and went\nforth into the world, and enjoyed himself, refraining from nothing\nthat did him good and his money harm.': 26, 'During the first year his appearance was passable, but during the\nsecond he began to look like a monster.': 19, 'His hair covered nearly the\nwhole of his face, his beard was like a piece of coarse felt, his\nfingers had claws, and his face was so covered with dirt that if\ncress had been sown on it, it would have come up.': 43, 'Whosoever saw him,\nran away, but as he everywhere gave the poor money to pray that he\nmight not die during the seven years, and as he paid well for\neverything he still always found shelter.': 36, 'In the fourth year, he entered an inn where the landlord would not\nreceive him, and would not even let him have a place in the stable,\nbecause he was afraid the horses would be scared.': 36, 'But as Bearskin\nthrust his hand into his pocket and pulled out a handful of ducats,\nthe host let himself be persuaded and gave him a room in an outhouse.': 30, 'Bearskin, however, was obliged to promise not to let himself be seen,\nlest the inn should get a bad name.': 20, 'As Bearskin was sitting alone in the evening, and wishing from the\nbottom of his heart that the seven years were over, he heard a loud\nlamenting in a neighboring room.': 31, 'He had a compassionate heart, so he\nopened the door, and saw an old man weeping bitterly, and wringing\nhis hands.': 21, 'Bearskin went nearer, but the man sprang to his feet and\ntried to escape from him.': 16, "At last when the man perceived that\nBearskin's voice was human he let himself be prevailed upon, and by\nkind words bearskin succeeded so far that the old man revealed the\ncause of his grief.": 35, 'His property had dwindled away by degrees, he and\nhis daughters would have to starve, and he was so poor that he could\nnot pay the innkeeper, and was to be put in prison.': 34, '"If that is your\nonly trouble," said Bearskin, "I have plenty of money."': 13, "He caused the\ninnkeeper to be brought thither, paid him and even put a purse full\nof gold into the poor old man's pocket.": 24, 'When the old man saw himself set free from all his troubles he did\nnot know how to show his gratitude.': 21, '"Come with me," said he to\nBearskin, "my daughters are all miracles of beauty, choose one of\nthem for yourself as a wife.': 23, 'When she hears what you have done for\nme, she will not refuse you.': 14, 'You do in truth look a little strange,\nbut she will soon put you to rights again."': 17, 'This pleased Bearskin\nwell, and he went.': 7, 'When the eldest saw him she was so terribly\nalarmed at his face that she screamed and ran away.': 19, 'The second stood\nstill and looked at him from head to foot, but then she said, "How\ncan I accept a husband who no longer has a human form?': 29, "The shaven\nbear that once was here and passed itself off for a man pleased me\nfar better, for at any rate it wore a hussar's dress and white\ngloves.": 30, 'If he were only ugly, I might get used to that."': 11, 'The\nyoungest, however, said, "Dear father, that must be a good man to\nhave helped you out of your trouble, so if you have promised him a\nbride for doing it, your promise must be kept."': 36, "It was a pity that\nBearskin's face was covered with dirt and with hair, for if not they\nmight have seen how delighted he was when he heard these words.": 30, 'He\ntook a ring from his finger, broke it in two, and gave her one half,\nthe other he kept for himself.': 22, 'Then he wrote his name on her half,\nand hers on his, and begged her to keep her piece carefully.': 20, 'Then he\ntook his leave and said, "I must still wander about for three years,\nand if I do not return then, you are free, for I shall be dead.': 30, 'But\npray to God to preserve my life."': 8, 'The poor betrothed bride dressed herself entirely in black, and when\nshe thought of her future bridegroom, tears came into her eyes.': 22, 'Nothing but contempt and mockery fell to her lot from her sisters.': 12, '"Take care," said the eldest, "if you give him your hand, he will\nstrike his claws into it."': 18, '"Beware," said the second.': 4, '"Bears like\nsweet things, and if he takes a fancy to you, he will eat you up."': 17, '"You must always do as he likes," began the elder again, or else he\nwill growl."': 16, 'And the second continued, "But the wedding will be a\nmerry one, for bears dance well."': 16, 'The bride was silent, and did not\nlet them vex her.': 11, 'Bearskin, however, traveled about the world from\none place to another, did good where he was able, and gave generously\nto the poor that they might pray for him.': 29, 'At length, as the last day of the seven years dawned, he went once\nmore out on to the heath, and seated himself beneath the circle of\ntrees.': 28, 'It was not long before the wind whistled, and the devil stood\nbefore him and looked angrily at him, then he threw bearskin his\ncoat, and asked for his own green one back.': 33, '"We have not got so far\nas that yet," answered Bearskin, "you must first make me clean."': 17, 'Whether the devil liked it or not, he was forced to fetch water, and\nwash Bearskin, comb his hair, and cut his nails.': 23, 'After this, he\nlooked like a brave soldier, and was much handsomer than he had ever\nbeen before.': 18, 'When the devil had gone away, Bearskin was quite lighthearted.': 10, "He\nwent into the town, put on a magnificent velvet coat, seated himself\nin a carriage drawn by four white horses, and drove to his bride's\nhouse.": 27, 'No one recognized him.': 4, 'The father took him for a\ndistinguished general, and led him into the room where his daughters\nwere sitting.': 19, 'He was forced to place himself between the two eldest,\nwho helped him to wine, gave him the best pieces of meat, and thought\nthat in all the world they had never seen a handsomer man.': 36, 'The\nbride, however, sat opposite to him in her black dress, and never\nraised her eyes, nor spoke a word.': 20, 'When at length he asked the\nfather if he would give him one of his daughters to wife, the two\neldest jumped up, ran into their bedrooms to put on splendid dresses,\nfor each of them fancied she was the chosen one.': 42, 'The stranger, as soon as he was alone with his bride, brought out his\nhalf of the ring, and threw it in a glass of wine which he handed\nacross the table to her.': 34, 'She took the wine, but when she had drunk\nit, and found the half ring lying at the bottom, her heart began to\nbeat.': 24, 'She got the other half, which she wore on a ribbon round her\nneck, joined them, and saw that the two pieces fitted exactly\ntogether.': 25, 'Then said he, "I am your betrothed bridegroom, whom you\nsaw as Bearskin, but through God\'s grace I have again received my\nhuman form, and have once more become clean."': 30, 'He went up to her,\nembraced her, and gave her a kiss.': 12, 'In the meantime the two sisters\ncame back in full dress, and when they saw that the handsome man had\nfallen to the share of the youngest, and heard that he was Bearskin,\nthey ran out full of anger and rage.': 41, 'One of them drowned herself in\nthe well, the other hanged herself on a tree.': 15, 'In the evening, some\none knocked at the door, and when the bridegroom opened it, it was\nthe devil in his green coat, who said, "You see, I have now got two\nsouls in the place of your one."': 39, 'There was once a girl who was idle and would not spin, and\nlet her mother say what she would, she could not bring her\nto it.': 27, 'At last the mother was once so overcome with anger\nand impatience, that she beat her, at which the girl began\nto weep loudly.': 24, 'Now at this very moment the queen drove by,\nand when she heard the weeping she stopped her carriage, went\ninto the house and asked the mother why she was beating her\ndaughter so that the cries could be heard out on the road.': 44, 'Then\nthe woman was ashamed to reveal the laziness of her daughter\nand said, I cannot get her to leave off spinning.': 22, 'She insists\non spinning for ever and ever, and I am poor, and cannot\nprocure the flax.': 17, 'Then\nanswered the queen, there is nothing that I like better to hear\nthan spinning, and I am never happier than when the wheels are\nhumming.': 26, 'Let me have your daughter with me in the palace.': 10, 'I\nhave flax enough, and there she shall spin as much as she likes.': 14, 'The mother was heartily satisfied with this, and the queen\ntook the girl with her.': 15, 'When they had arrived at the palace,\nshe led her up into three rooms which were filled from the\nbottom to the top with the finest flax.': 27, 'Now spin me this flax,\nsaid she, and when you have done it, you shall have my eldest\nson for a husband, even if you are poor.': 27, 'I care not for that,\nyour untiring industry is dowry enough.': 11, 'The girl was secretly\nterrified, for she could not have spun the flax, no, not if\nshe had lived till she was three hundred years old, and had\nsat at it every day from morning till night.': 37, 'When therefore she\nwas alone, she began to weep, and sat thus for three days\nwithout moving a finger.': 19, "On the third day came the queen, and\nwhen she saw that nothing had yet been spun, she was surprised,\nbut the girl excused herself by saying that she had not been able\nto begin because of her great distress at leaving her mother's\nhouse.": 45, 'The queen was satisfied with this, but said when she was\ngoing away, tomorrow you must begin to work.': 19, 'When the girl was alone again, she did not know what to do, and\nin her distress went to the window.': 21, 'Then she saw three women\ncoming towards her, the first of whom had a broad flat foot, the\nsecond had such a great underlip that it hung down over her chin,\nand the third had a broad thumb.': 38, 'They remained standing before\nthe window, looked up, and asked the girl what was amiss with\nher.': 17, 'She complained of her trouble, and then they offered\nher their help and said, if you will invite us to the wedding,\nnot be ashamed of us, and will call us your aunts, and likewise\nwill place us at your table, we will spin up the flax for you,\nand that in a very short time.': 56, 'With all my heart, she replied,\ndo but come in and begin the work at once.': 16, 'Then she let in the\nthree strange women, and cleared a place in the first room,\nwhere they seated themselves and began their spinning.': 24, 'The one\ndrew the thread and trod the wheel, the other wetted the thread,\nthe third twisted it, and struck the table\nwith her finger, and as often as she struck it, a skein of\nthread fell to the ground that was spun in the finest manner\npossible.': 48, 'The girl concealed the three spinners from the queen,\nand showed her whenever she came the great quantity of spun\nthread, until the latter could not praise her enough.': 29, 'When\nthe first room was empty she went to the second, and at last to\nthe third, and that too was quickly cleared.': 23, 'Then the three women\ntook leave and said to the girl, do not forget what you have\npromised us - it will make your fortune.': 25, 'When the maiden showed the queen the empty rooms, and the great\nheap of yarn, she gave orders for the wedding, and the bridegroom\nrejoiced that he was to have such a clever and industrious wife,\nand praised her mightily.': 40, 'I have three aunts, said the girl,\nand as they have been very kind to me, I should not like to\nforget them in my good fortune, allow me to invite them to the\nwedding, and let them sit with us at table.': 43, 'The queen and the\nbridegroom said, why should we not allow that.': 12, 'Therefore when\nthe feast began, the three women entered in strange apparel, and\nthe bride said, welcome, dear aunts.': 19, 'Ah, said the bridegroom,\nhow do you come by these odious friends.': 12, 'Thereupon he went to\nthe one with the broad flat foot, and said, how do you come by\nsuch a broad foot.': 22, 'By treading, she answered, by treading.': 6, 'Then\nthe bridegroom went to the second, and said, how do you come by\nyour falling lip.': 17, 'By licking, she answered, by licking.': 6, 'Then\nhe asked the third, how do you come by your broad thumb.': 13, 'By\ntwisting the thread, she answered, by twisting the thread.': 10, "On\nthis the king's son was alarmed and said, neither now nor ever\nshall my beautiful bride touch a spinning-wheel.": 20, 'And thus she\ngot rid of the hateful flax-spinning.': 9, 'There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain\nwished for a child.': 17, 'At length the woman hoped that God\nwas about to grant her desire.': 13, 'These people had a little\nwindow at the back of their house from which a splendid garden\ncould be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and\nherbs.': 30, 'It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one\ndared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had\ngreat power and was dreaded by all the world.': 33, 'One day the woman\nwas standing by this window and looking down into the garden,\nwhen she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful\nrampion - rapunzel, and it looked so fresh and green that she\nlonged for it, and had the greatest desire to eat some.': 50, 'This desire\nincreased every day, and as she knew that she could not get any\nof it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable.': 28, 'Then her husband was alarmed, and asked, what ails you, dear\nwife.': 12, "Ah, she replied, if I can't eat some of the rampion, which\nis in the garden behind our house, I shall die.": 22, 'The man, who loved\nher, thought, sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of\nthe rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.': 25, 'At twilight, he\nclambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress,\nhastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife.': 26, 'She\nat once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily.': 13, 'It tasted\nso good to her - so very good, that the next day she longed for it\nthree times as much as before.': 24, 'If he was to have any rest, her\nhusband must once more descend into the garden.': 16, 'In the gloom of\nevening, therefore, he let himself down again.': 11, 'But when he had\nclambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the\nenchantress standing before him.': 20, 'How can you dare, said she with\nangry look, descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a\nthief.': 20, 'You shall suffer for it.': 5, 'Ah, answered he, let mercy take\nthe place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of\nnecessity.': 22, 'My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such\na longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some\nto eat.': 28, 'Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and\nsaid to him, if the case be as you say, I will allow you to take\naway with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one\ncondition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring\ninto the world.': 54, 'It shall be well treated, and I will care for it\nlike a mother.': 14, 'The man in his terror consented to everything, and\nwhen the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once,\ngave the child the name of rapunzel, and took it away with her.': 34, 'Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun.': 10, 'When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a\ntower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but\nquite at the top was a little window.': 33, 'When the enchantress\nwanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried,\n     rapunzel, rapunzel,\n     let down your hair to me.': 22, 'Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when\nshe heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided\ntresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above,\nand then the hair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed\nup by it.': 49, "After a year or two, it came to pass that the king's son rode\nthrough the forest and passed by the tower.": 22, 'Then he heard a song,\nwhich was so charming that he stood still and listened.': 15, 'This was\nrapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet\nvoice resound.': 16, "The king's son wanted to climb up to her, and\nlooked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found.": 23, 'He\nrode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that\nevery day he went out into the forest and listened to it.': 25, 'Once when\nhe was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress\ncame there, and he heard how she cried,\n     rapunzel, rapunzel,\n     let down your hair.': 28, 'Then rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the\nenchantress climbed up to her.': 16, 'If that is the ladder by which one\nmounts, I too will try my fortune, said he, and the next day when\nit began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried,\n     rapunzel, rapunzel,\n     let down your hair.': 40, "Immediately the hair fell down and the king's son climbed up.": 11, 'At first rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as\nher eyes had never yet beheld, came to her.': 20, "But the king's son\nbegan to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his\nheart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he\nhad been forced to see her.": 39, 'Then rapunzel lost her fear, and when\nhe asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that\nhe was young and handsome, she thought, he will love me more than\nold dame gothel does.': 39, 'And she said yes, and laid her hand in his.': 10, 'She said, I will willingly go away with you, but I do not know\nhow to get down.': 18, 'Bring with you a skein of silk every time that\nyou come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready\nI will descend, and you will take me on your horse.': 36, 'They agreed\nthat until that time he should come to her every evening, for the\nold woman came by day.': 20, "The enchantress remarked nothing of\nthis, until once rapunzel said to her, tell me, dame gothel, how\nit happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than\nthe young king's son - he is with me in a moment.": 43, 'Ah.': 1, 'You\nwicked child, cried the enchantress.': 6, 'What do I hear you say.': 6, 'I\nthought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have\ndeceived me.': 16, "In her anger she clutched rapunzel's beautiful\ntresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of\nscissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the\nlovely braids lay on the ground.": 38, 'And she was so pitiless that she\ntook poor rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great\ngrief and misery.': 23, "On the same day that she cast out rapunzel, however, the\nenchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to\nthe hook of the window, and when the king's son came and cried,\n     rapunzel, rapunzel,\n     let down your hair,\nshe let the hair down.": 47, "The king's son ascended, but instead of\nfinding his dearest rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed\nat him with wicked and venomous looks.": 24, 'Aha, she cried mockingly,\nyou would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits\nno longer singing in the nest.': 20, 'The cat has got it, and will scratch\nout your eyes as well.': 13, 'Rapunzel is lost to you.': 5, 'You will never see\nher again.': 6, "The king's son was beside himself with pain, and in\nhis despair he leapt down from the tower.": 18, 'He escaped with his life,\nbut the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes.': 15, 'Then he\nwandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and\nberries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his\ndearest wife.': 28, 'Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at\nlength came to the desert where rapunzel, with the twins to which\nshe had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness.': 35, 'He\nheard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards\nit, and when he approached, rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck\nand wept.': 30, 'Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear\nagain, and he could see with them as before.': 20, 'He led her to his\nkingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long\ntime afterwards, happy and contented.': 22, 'There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and\nloved them with all the love of a mother for her children.': 27, 'One day\nshe wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food.': 13, 'So she called\nall seven to her and said, dear children, I have to go into the\nforest, be on your guard against the wolf, if he comes in, he will\ndevour you all - skin, hair, and everything.': 39, 'The wretch often\ndisguises himself, but you will know him at once by his rough voice\nand his black feet.': 20, 'The kids said, dear mother, we will take good\ncare of ourselves, you may go away without any anxiety.': 19, 'Then the old\none bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind.': 14, 'It was not long before some one knocked at the house-door and called,\nopen the door, dear children, your mother is here, and has brought\nsomething back with her for each of you.': 33, 'But the little kids knew\nthat it was the wolf, by the rough voice.': 14, 'We will not open the door,\ncried they, you are not our mother.': 13, 'She has a soft, pleasant voice,\nbut your voice is rough, you are the wolf.': 15, 'Then the wolf went away\nto a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this\nand made his voice soft with it.': 25, 'The he came back, knocked at the\ndoor of the house, and called, open the door, dear children, your\nmother is here and has brought something back with her for each of\nyou.': 33, 'But the wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and\nthe children saw them and cried, we will not open the door, our\nmother has not black feet like you, you are the wolf.': 36, 'Then the wolf\nran to a baker and said, I have hurt my feet, rub some dough over\nthem for me.': 21, 'And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to\nthe miller and said, strew some white meal over my feet for me.': 25, 'The\nmiller thought to himself, the wolf wants to deceive someone, and\nrefused, but the wolf said, if you will not do it, I will devour you.': 27, 'Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him.': 12, 'Truly,\nthis the way of mankind.': 6, 'So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked\nat it and said, open the door for me, children, your dear little\nmother has come home, and has brought every one of you something back\nfrom the forest with her.': 44, 'The little kids cried, first show us your\npaws that we may know if you are our dear little mother.': 20, 'Then he put\nhis paws in through the window, and when the kids saw that they were\nwhite, they believed that all he said was true, and opened the door.': 30, 'But who should come in but the wolf they were terrified and wanted to\nhide themselves.': 16, 'One sprang under the table, the second into the\nbed, the third into the stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth\ninto the cupboard, the sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh\ninto the clock-case.': 36, 'But the wolf found them all, and used no great\nceremony, one after the other he swallowed them down his throat.': 21, 'The\nyoungest, who was in the clock-case, was the only one he did not\nfind.': 15, 'When the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off,\nlaid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began\nto sleep.': 26, 'Soon afterwards the old goat came home again from the\nforest.': 11, 'What a sight she saw there.': 6, 'The house-door stood wide\nopen.': 5, 'The table, chairs, and benches were thrown down, the\nwashing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts and pillows were\npulled off the bed.': 24, 'She sought her children, but they were nowhere\nto be found.': 11, 'She called them one after another by name, but no one\nanswered.': 12, 'At last, when she caame to the youngest, a soft voice\ncried, dear mother, I am in the clock-case.': 19, 'She took the kid out,\nand it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others.': 20, 'Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.': 11, 'At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with\nher.': 15, 'When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree\nand snored so loud that the branches shook.': 21, 'She looked at him on\nevery side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his\ngorged belly.': 19, 'Ah, heavens, she said, is it possible that my poor\nchildren whom he has swallowed down for his supper, can be still\nalive.': 23, "Then the kid had to run home and fetch scissors, and a needle\nand thread and the goat cut open the monster's stomach, and hardly\nhad she make one cut, than one little kid thrust its head out, and\nwhen she cut farther, all six sprang out one after another, and were\nall still alive, and had suffered no injury whatever, for in his\ngreediness the monster had swallowed them down whole.": 72, 'What rejoicing\nthere was.': 4, 'They embraced their dear mother, and jumped like a sailor\nat his wedding.': 13, "The mother, however, said, now go and look for some\nbig stones, and we will fill the wicked beast's stomach with them\nwhile he is still asleep.": 27, 'Then the seven kids dragged the stones\nthither with all speed, and put as many of them into his stomach as\nthey could get in, and the mother sewed him up again in the greatest\nhaste, so that he was not aware of anything and never
