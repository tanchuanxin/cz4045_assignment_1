DANGER
• For refrigerant leakage, consult your dealer.
Refrigerant gas is heavier than air and replaces oxygen. A massive leak could lead to oxygen depletion, especially in basements,
and an asphyxiation hazard could occur leading to serious injury or death.
• Refrigerant gas may produce a toxic gas if it comes in contact with fi re such as from a fan heater, stove or cooking device. Exposure
to this gas could cause severe injury or death.
• Any abnormalities in the operation of the air conditioner such as smoke or fi re could result in severe injury or death.
Turn off the power and contact your dealer immediately for instructions.
• Do not install the unit in an area where fl ammable materials are present due to risk of explosion resulting in serious injury or death.
• If equipment utilizing a burner is used in the same room as the air conditioner, there is the danger of oxygen defi ciency which could
lead to an asphyxiation hazard resulting in serious injury or death.
Be sure to ventilate the room suffi ciently to avoid this hazard.
• Safely dispose of the packing materials.
Packing materials, such as nails and other metal or wooden parts, may cause stabs or other injuries. Tear apart and throw away
plastic packaging bags so that children will not play with them. Children playing with plastic bags face the danger of death by
suffocation.
WARNING

ATTENTION
 About batteries
• When replacing the batteries, use batteries of the same type, and replace both batteries at the same time.
• When the system is not used for a long time, take the batteries out.
• The batteries will last for approximately 1 year. If the remote controller display begins to fade and the degradation of reception performance occurs
within a year, however, replace both batteries with new, size AAA.LR03 (alkaline).
• The attached batteries are provided for the initial use of the system.
The usable period of the batteries may be short depending on the manufactured date of the air conditioner.
 About remote controller
• Never expose the remote controller to direct sunlight.
• Dust on the signal transmitter or receiver will reduce the sensitivity. Wipe off dust with a soft cloth.
• Signal communication may be disabled if an electronic-starter-type fl uorescent lamp (such as inverter-type lamps) is in the room. Consult the shop
if that is the case.
• If the remote controller signals happen to operate another appliance, move that appliance somewhere else, or consult the service shop.
 Celsius/Fahrenheit display change function of remote controller
• The set temperature may increase when the display is changed to Celsius from Fahrenheit, because a fraction of 0.5°C is rounded up.
• Example: A set temperature of 64°F (equivalent to 18.5°C) will be converted into 19°C.
When the display is changed to Fahrenheit again, the set temperature will be converted into 66°F (equivalent to 19°C) instead of the
original set temperature (64°F) but a set temperature of 66°F (equivalent to 19°C) will be converted into 19°C with no temperature change.
• A reception sound will go off for the transmission of set temperature to the indoor unit at the time of setting the Celsius/Fahrenheit display change function.

NOTE
 Notes on HEAT operation
• Since this air conditioner heats the room by taking heat from outdoor air to indoors, the heating capacity becomes smaller in lower outdoor
temperatures. If the heating effect is insuffi cient, it is recommended to use another heating appliance in combination with the air conditioner.
• The heat pump system heats the room by circulating hot air around all parts of the room. After the start of HEAT operation, it takes some time
before the room gets warmer.
• In HEAT operation, frost may occur on the outdoor unit and lower the heating capacity. In that case, the system switches into defrosting operation
to take away the frost.
• During defrosting operation, hot air does not fl ow out of indoor unit.
 Note on COOL operation
• This air conditioner cools the room by blowing the hot air in the room outside, so if the outside temperature is high, the performance of the air
conditioner drops.
 Note on DRY operation
• The computer chip works to rid the room of humidity while maintaining the temperature as much as possible. It automatically controls temperature
and airfl ow rate, so manual adjustment of these functions is unavailable.
 Notes on AUTO operation
• In AUTO operation, the system selects a temperature setting and an appropriate operation mode (COOL or HEAT) based on the room
temperature at the start of the operation.
• The system automatically reselects setting at a regular interval to bring the room temperature to user-setting level.
 Note on FAN operation
• This is valid for fan only.
 Note on airfl ow rate setting
• At smaller airfl ow rates, the cooling (heating) effect is also smaller.

Note for Multi System
What is a multi system?
This system has one outdoor unit connected to multiple
indoor units.
 Selecting the operation mode
1. With the priority room setting present but
inactive or not present.
When more than one indoor unit is operating, priority is
given to the fi rst unit that was turned on.
In this case, set the units that are turned on later to the
same operation mode (*1) as the fi rst unit.
Otherwise, they will enter the standby state, and the
OPERATION lamp will fl ash: this does not indicate malfunction.
(*1)
• COOL, DRY and FAN operation may be used at the same time.
• AUTO operation automatically selects COOL operation or HEAT operation based on the room temperature.
Therefore, AUTO operation is available when selecting the same operation mode as that of the room with the fi rst unit to be
turned on.
 CAUTION
• Normally, the operation mode in the room where the unit is fi rst run is given priority, but the following situations are exceptions, so please
keep this in mind.
If the operation mode of the fi rst room is FAN operation, then using HEAT operation in any room after this will give priority to HEAT operation.
In this situation, the air conditioner running in FAN operation will go on standby, and the OPERATION lamp will fl ash.

Troubleshooting
These incidents are not malfunctions.
The following incidents do not indicate a malfunctioning air conditioner and have explanations. The air conditioner can continue to
operate.
Case Explanation
Operation does not start soon.
• When “ON/OFF” button was pressed soon after
operation was stopped.
• When the mode was reselected.
• This is to protect the air conditioner.
You should wait for about 3 minutes.
Hot air does not fl ow out soon after the
start of HEAT operation.
• The air conditioner is warming up. You should wait for 1 to 4 minutes.
(The system is designed to start discharging air only after it has reached a certain
temperature.)
The HEAT operation stops suddenly and
a fl owing sound is heard.
• The system is taking away the frost on the outdoor unit.
You should wait for about 4 to 12 minutes.
The outdoor unit emits water or steam.
 In HEAT operation
• The frost on the outdoor unit melts into water or steam when the air conditioner is in
defrost operation.
 In COOL or DRY operation
• Moisture in the air condenses into water on the cool surface of outdoor unit piping and
drips.
Mist comes out of the indoor unit.
 This happens when the air in the room is cooled into mist by the cold airfl ow
during COOL operation.
 This is because the air in the room is cooled by the heat exchanger and
becomes mist during defrost operation.
The indoor unit gives out odor.
 This happens when smells of the room, furniture, or cigarettes are absorbed
into the unit and discharged with the airfl ow.
If this happens, it is recommended to have the indoor unit washed by a
technician. Consult the service shop where you purchased the air conditioner.
The outdoor fan rotates while the air
conditioner is not in operation.
 After operation is stopped
• The outdoor fan continues rotating for another 60 seconds for system protection.
 While the air conditioner is not in operation
• When the outdoor temperature is very high, the outdoor fan starts rotating for system
protection.
Operation stopped suddenly.
(OPERATION lamp is on.)
• For system protection, the air conditioner may stop operating on a sudden large voltage
fl uctuation.
It automatically resumes operation in about 3 minutes.
No remote controller signals are
displayed.
Remote controller sensitivity is low.
Display is low in contrast or blacked out.
Display runs out of control.
• The batteries are dying and the remote controller is malfunctioning. Replace all the
batteries with new size batteries, AAA.LR03 (alkaline). For details, refer to set the batteries
of this manual. Page 8

English
Case Explanation
Possible sounds.
 Flowing water
• Generated because the refrigerant in the air conditioner is fl owing.
• This is a pumping sound of the water in the air conditioner and heard when the water is
pumped out from the air conditioner in cooling or drying operation.
• The refrigerant fl ows in the air conditioner even if the air conditioner is not working when
the indoor units in other rooms are in operation.
 Blowing
• Generated when the fl ow of the refrigerant in the air conditioner is switched over.
 Pinging
• Generated when the size of the air conditioner slightly expands or shrinks as a result of
temperature changes.
Check again.
Please check again before calling a repair person.
Case Check
The air conditioner does not operate.
(OPERATION lamp is off.)
• Is a breaker off or a fuse blown?
• Is there a power failure?
• Are batteries set in the remote controller?
• Is the timer setting correct?
Cooling (Heating) effect is poor.
• Are the air fi lters clean?
• Is there anything to block the air inlet or the outlet of the indoor and the outdoor units?
• Is the temperature setting appropriate?
• Are the windows and doors closed?
• Are the airfl ow rate and the airfl ow direction set appropriately?
Operation stopped suddenly.
(OPERATION lamp fl ashes.)
• Are the air fi lters clean?
• Is there anything to block the air inlet or the outlet of the indoor and the outdoor units?
• Clean the air fi lters or take all obstacles away and turn the breaker off. Then turn it on
again and try operating the air conditioner with the remote controller. If the lamp still
fl ashes, call the service shop where you purchased the air conditioner.
• Are operation modes all the same for indoor units connected to outdoor units in the multi
system?
If not, set all indoor units to the same operating mode and confi rm that the lamps fl ash.
Moreover, when the operating mode is in AUTO, set all indoor unit operating modes to
COOL or HEAT for a moment and check again that the lamps are normal.
If the lamps stop fl ashing after the above steps, there is no malfunction. Page 22
An abnormal functioning happens during
operation.
• The air conditioner may malfunction with lightning or radio waves. Turn the breaker off,
turn it on again and try operating the air conditioner with the remote controller.
The louvers do not immediately swing.
