3 Connecting to a network
Your computer can travel with you wherever you go. But even at home, you can explore the globe and access
information from millions of websites using your computer and a wired or wireless network connection. This
chapter will help you get connected to that world.
Connecting to a wireless network
Your computer may be equipped with one or more of the following wireless devices:
● WLAN device—Connects the computer to wireless local area networks (commonly referred to as Wi-Fi
networks, wireless LANs, or WLANs) in corporate offices, your home, and public places such as airports,
restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, and universities. In a WLAN, the mobile wireless device in your
computer communicates with a wireless router or a wireless access point.
● HP Mobile Broadband Module—Gives you wireless connectivity over a wireless wide area network
(WWAN), a much larger area. Mobile network operators install base stations (similar to cell phone
towers) throughout large geographic areas, effectively providing coverage across entire states, regions,
or even countries.
● Bluetooth® device—Creates a personal area network (PAN) to connect to other Bluetooth-enabled
devices such as computers, phones, printers, headsets, speakers, and cameras. In a PAN, each device
communicates directly with other devices, and devices must be relatively close together—typically
within 10 meters (approximately 33 feet) of each other.
Using the wireless controls
You can control the wireless devices in your computer using one or more of these features:
● Airplane mode key (also called wireless button or wireless key) (referred to in this chapter as airplane
mode key)
● Operating system controls
Airplane mode key
The computer may have an airplane mode key, one or more wireless devices, and one or two wireless lights.
All the wireless devices on your computer are enabled at the factory.
The wireless light indicates the overall power state of your wireless devices, not the status of individual
devices.
Operating system controls
The Network and Sharing Center allows you to set up a connection or network, connect to a network, and
diagnose and repair network problems.
To use operating system controls:
1. Type control panel in the taskbar search box, and then select Control Panel.
2. Select Network and Internet, and then select Network and Sharing Center.
16 Chapter 3 Connecting to a network
Connecting to a WLAN
NOTE: When you are setting up Internet access in your home, you must establish an account with an
Internet service provider (ISP). To purchase Internet service and a modem, contact a local ISP. The ISP will
help set up the modem, install a network cable to connect your wireless router to the modem, and test the
Internet service.
To connect to a WLAN, follow these steps:
1. Be sure that the WLAN device is on.
2. Select the network status icon in the taskbar, and then connect to one of the available networks.
If the WLAN is a security-enabled WLAN, you are prompted to enter a security code. Enter the code, and
then select Next to complete the connection.
NOTE: If no WLANs are listed, you may be out of range of a wireless router or access point.
NOTE: If you do not see the WLAN you want to connect to, right-click the network status icon in the
taskbar, and then select Open Network and Sharing Center. Select Set up a new connection or
network. A list of options is displayed, allowing you to manually search for and connect to a network or
to create a new network connection.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the connection.
After the connection is made, select the network status icon at the far right of the taskbar, to verify the name
and status of the connection.
NOTE: The functional range (how far your wireless signals travel) depends on WLAN implementation, router
manufacturer, and interference from other electronic devices or structural barriers such as walls and Ʈoors.
Connecting to a wireless network 17
Using HP Mobile Broadband (select products only)
Your HP Mobile Broadband computer has built-in support for mobile broadband service. Your new computer,
when used with a mobile operator’s network, gives you the freedom to connect to the Internet, send e-mail,
or connect to your corporate network without the need for Wi-Fi hotspots.
You might need the HP Mobile Broadband Module IMEI and/or MEID number to activate mobile broadband
service. The number may be printed on a label located on the bottom of your computer, inside the battery bay,
under the service door, or on the back of the display.
‒ or –
You can find the number following these steps:
1. From the taskbar, select the network status icon.
2. Select View Connection Settings.
3. Under the Mobile broadband section, select the network status icon.
Some mobile network operators require the use of a subscriber identity module (SIM) card. A SIM card
contains basic information about you, such as a personal identification number (PIN), as well as network
information. Some computers include a SIM card that is preinstalled. If the SIM card is not preinstalled, it may
be included with the HP Mobile Broadband documents provided with your computer, or the mobile network
operator may provide it separately from the computer.
For information about HP Mobile Broadband and how to activate service with a preferred mobile network
operator, see the HP Mobile Broadband information included with your computer.
Using GPS (select products only)
Your computer may be equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS) device. GPS satellites deliver location,
speed, and direction information to GPS-equipped systems.
To enable GPS, make sure location is enabled under the Location setting.
1. Type location in the taskbar search box, and then make the selection for location.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions for using location settings.
