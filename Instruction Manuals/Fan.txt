This fan is equiped with an IONIC SYSTEM (A1 + A2) and a SILENT NIGHT FUNCTION (B)
"IONIC" SYSTEM
The negative ions that are effectively released by your appliance rebalance the air in the room so as to create
the feeling of well-being that one feels in the mountains, near a waterfall or at the seaside where negative ions
are naturally found in very large numbers.
Your appliance spreads up to 3 million negative ions / cm3 into the air.
See Operation below.
- Press the A2 button to activate the ionizer: the red indicator turns on
- Press the A2 button back to stop the ionizer: the red indicator turns off
PLEASE NOTE : The ionic function must be used only when a speed is switched on.
SILENT NIGHT FUNCTION
The SILENT NIGHT FUNCTION (B) is a speed which has been specially developped to provide smooth and
quiet airflow during the night.
IMPORTANT:
We advise you to unplug your appliance when it is not in use.
