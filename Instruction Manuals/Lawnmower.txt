General Power Tool Safety Warnings
WARNING Read all safety warnings
and instructions. Failure to follow the
warnings and instructions may result
in electric shock, fire and/or serious
injury.
Save all warnings and instructions
for future reference.
The term ″power tool″ in the warnings
refers to your mains-operated (corded)
power tool or battery-operated
(cordless) power tool.
1. Work area safety
a. Keep work area clean and well lit.
Cluttered or dark areas invite accidents.
b. Do not operate power tools in
explosive atmospheres, such as in
the presence of flammable liquids,
gases or dust. Power tools create
sparks which may ignite the dust or
fumes.
c. Keep children and bystanders
away while operating a power tool.
Distractions can cause you to lose
control.
2. Electrical safety
a. Power tool plugs must match the
outlet. Never modify the plug in
any way. Do not use any adapter
plugs with grounded power tools.
Unmodified plugs and matching outlets
will reduce risk of electric shock.
b. Avoid body contact with grounded
surfaces such as pipes, radiators, 
SKU 94245 For technical questions, please call 1-800-444-3353. Page 3

ranges and refrigerators. There is an
increased risk of electric shock if your
body is grounded.
c. Do not expose power tools to rain
or wet conditions. Water entering
a power tool will increase the risk of
electric shock.
d. Do not abuse the cord. Never use
the cord for carrying, pulling or
unplugging the power tool. Keep
cord away from heat, oil, sharp
edges or moving parts. Damaged
or entangled cords increase the risk of
electric shock.
e. When operating a power tool
outdoors, use an extension cord
suitable for outdoor use. Use of a
cord suitable for outdoor use reduces
the risk of electric shock.
f. If operating a power tool in a damp
location is unavoidable, use a
Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter
(GFCI) protected supply. Use of a
GFCI reduces the risk of electric shock.
3. Personal safety
a. Stay alert, watch what you are
doing and use common sense when
operating a power tool. Do not use
a power tool while you are tired or
under the influence of drugs, alcohol
or medication. A moment of inattention
while operating power tools may result
in serious personal injury.
b. Use safety equipment. Always wear
eye protection. Safety equipment such
as dust mask, non-skid safety shoes,
hard hat, or hearing protection used
for appropriate conditions will reduce
personal injuries.
c. Prevent unintentional starting.
Ensure the switch is in the offposition before connecting to power
source and/or battery pack, picking
up or carrying the tool. Carrying
power tools with your finger on the
switch or energizing power tools that
have the switch on invites accidents.
d. Remove any adjusting key or wrench
before turning the power tool on.
A wrench or a key left attached to a
rotating part of the power tool may result
in personal injury.
e. Do not overreach. Keep proper
footing and balance at all times. This
enables better control of the power tool
in unexpected situations.
f. Dress properly. Do not wear loose
clothing or jewelry. Keep your hair,
clothing and gloves away from
moving parts. Loose clothes, jewelry
or long hair can be caught in moving
parts.
g. If devices are provided for the
connection of dust extraction and
collection facilities, ensure these are
connected and properly used. Use of
these devices can reduce dust-related
hazards.
h. Only use safety equipment that has
been approved by an appropriate
standards agency. Unapproved
safety equipment may not provide
adequate protection. Eye protection
must be ANSI-approved and breathing
protection must be NIOSH-approved for
the specific hazards in the work area.
4. Power tool use and care
a. Do not force the power tool. Use
the correct power tool for your
application. The correct power tool will
do the job better and safer at the rate
for which it was designed.
b. Do not use the power tool if the
switch does not turn it on and off.
Any power tool that cannot be controlled 
SKU 94245 For technical questions, please call 1-800-444-3353. Page 4

with the switch is dangerous and must
be repaired.
c. Disconnect the plug from the power
source and/or the battery pack from
the power tool before making any
adjustments, changing accessories,
or storing power tools. Such
preventive safety measures reduce
the risk of starting the power tool
accidentally.
d. Store idle power tools out of the
reach of children and do not allow
persons unfamiliar with the power
tool or these instructions to operate
the power tool. Power tools are
dangerous in the hands of untrained
users.
e. Maintain power tools. Check for
misalignment or binding of moving
parts, breakage of parts and any
other condition that may affect the
power tool’s operation. If damaged,
have the power tool repaired before
use. Many accidents are caused by
poorly maintained power tools.
f. Keep cutting tools sharp and clean.
Properly maintained cutting tools with
sharp cutting edges are less likely to
bind and are easier to control.
g. Use the power tool, accessories and
blades etc. in accordance with these
instructions, taking into account the
working conditions and the work
to be performed. Use of the power
tool for operations different from those
intended could result in a hazardous
situation.
5. Service
a. Have your power tool serviced by a
qualified repair person using only
identical replacement parts. This will
ensure that the safety of the power tool
is maintained.
Circular Saw Safety Warnings
1. DANGER: Keep hands away from
cutting area and the blade. Keep your
second hand on auxiliary handle,
or motor housing. If both hands are
holding the saw, they cannot be cut by
the blade.
2. Do not reach underneath the
workpiece. The guard cannot protect
you from the blade below the workpiece.
3. Adjust the cutting depth to the
thickness of the workpiece. Less than
a full tooth of the blade teeth should be
visible below the workpiece.
4. Never hold piece being cut in your
hands or across your leg. Secure the
workpiece to a stable platform. It is
important to support the work properly to
minimize body exposure, blade binding,
or loss of control.
5. Hold power tool by insulated gripping
surfaces when performing an
operation where the cutting tool may
contact hidden wiring or its own cord.
Contact with a″ live″ wire will also make
exposed metal parts of the power tool ″
live″ and shock the operator.
6. When ripping always use a rip fence
or straight edge guide. This improves
the accuracy of cut and reduces the
chance of blade binding.
7. Always use blades with correct size
and shape (diamond versus round) of
arbor holes. Blades that do not match
the mounting hardware of the saw will
run eccentrically, causing loss of control.
8. Never use damaged or incorrect blade
washers or bolt. The blade washers
and bolt were specially designed for
your saw, for optimum performance and
safety of operation.

9. Causes and Operator Prevention of
Kickback:
•	 Kickback is a sudden reaction to a
pinched, bound or misaligned saw
blade, causing an uncontrolled saw to
lift up and out of the workpiece toward
the operator;
•	 When the blade is pinched or bound
tightly by the kerf closing down, the
blade stalls and the motor reaction
drives the unit rapidly back toward the
operator;
•	 If the blade becomes twisted or
misaligned in the cut, the teeth at the
back edge of the blade can dig into the
top surface of the wood causing the
blade to climb out of the kerf and jump
back toward the operator.
Kickback is the result of saw misuse
and/or incorrect operating procedures or
conditions and can be avoided by taking
proper precautions as given below:
a. Maintain a firm grip with both hands
on the saw and position your arms
to resist kickback forces. Position
your body to either side of the
blade, but not in line with the blade.
Kickback could cause the saw to jump
backwards, but kickback forces can
be controlled by the operator, if proper
precautions are taken.
b. When blade is binding, or when
interrupting a cut for any reason,
release the trigger and hold the
saw motionless in the material until
the blade comes to a complete
stop. Never attempt to remove
the saw from the work or pull the
saw backward while the blade is
in motion or kickback may occur.
Investigate and take corrective actions
to eliminate the cause of blade binding.
c. When restarting a saw in the
workpiece, center the saw blade in
the kerf and check that saw teeth
are not engaged into the material. If
saw blade is binding, it may walk up or
kickback from the workpiece as the saw
is restarted.
d. Support large panels to minimize the
risk of blade pinching and kickback.
Large panels tend to sag under their
own weight. Supports must be placed
under the panel on both sides, near
the line of cut and near the edge of the
panel.
e. Do not use dull or damaged blades.
Unsharpened or improperly set blades
produce narrow kerf causing excessive
friction, blade binding and kickback.
f. Blade depth and bevel adjusting
locking levers must be tight and
secure before making cut. If blade
adjustment shifts while cutting, it may
cause binding and kickback.
g. Use extra caution when making a
″plunge cut″ into existing walls or
other blind areas. The protruding
blade may cut objects that can cause
kickback.
10. Check lower guard for proper closing
before each use. Do not operate the
saw if lower guard does not move
freely and close instantly. Never
clamp or tie the lower guard into the
open position. If saw is accidentally
dropped, lower guard may be bent.
Raise the lower guard with the retracting
handle and make sure it moves freely
and does not touch the blade or any
other part, in all angles and depths of
cut.
11. Check the operation of the lower
guard spring. If the guard and the
spring are not operating properly,
they must be serviced before use.
Lower guard may operate sluggishly due 
SKU 94245 For technical questions, please call 1-800-444-3353. Page 6

to damaged parts, gummy deposits, or a
build-up of debris.
12. Lower guard should be retracted
manually only for special cuts such
as ″plunge cuts″ and ″compound
cuts.″ Raise lower guard by retracting
handle and as soon as blade enters
the material, the lower guard must be
released. For all other sawing, the lower
guard should operate automatically.
13. Always observe that the lower guard
is covering the blade before placing
saw down on bench or floor. An
unprotected, coasting blade will cause
the saw to walk backwards, cutting
whatever is in its path. Be aware of the
time it takes for the blade to stop after
switch is released.
14. Do not use this saw with the
saw held upside down in a vise.
The saw is not designed for such use
and cannot be used safely in that
position.
15. Do not use to cut logs, tree limbs, or
uneven lumber.
16. Wet lumber, green (unseasoned)
lumber, and pressure treated lumber
all have an increased potential for
kickback and should only be cut with
a blade for cutting that lumber type.
Wear a NIOSH-approved respirator
and have appropriate ventilation
whenever cutting pressure treated
lumber.
17. Do not use blades made from highspeed steel, abrasive blades, metalcutting blades or masonry-cutting
blades. The guards of this saw are not
designed to protect against the failure of
such blades.
18. Place the larger portion of the saw
base on the larger, supported part of
the workpiece. This will help maintain
balance and control while the cut is
completed.
19. Blades must be rated to at least the
maximum speed marked on the tool.
20. Maintain labels and nameplates on
the tool. These carry important safety
information. If unreadable or missing,
contact Harbor Freight Tools for a
replacement.
21. Avoid unintentional starting. Prepare to
begin work before turning on the tool.
22. Do not lay the tool down until it has come
to a complete stop. Moving parts can
grab the surface and pull the tool out of
your control.
23. When using a handheld power tool,
maintain a firm grip on the tool with both
hands to resist starting torque.
24. Do not leave the tool unattended when
it is plugged into an electrical outlet.
Turn off the tool, and unplug it from its
electrical outlet before leaving.
25. Use clamps (not included) or other
practical ways to secure and support the
workpiece to a stable platform. Holding
the work by hand or against your body is
unstable and may lead to loss of control.
26. This product is not a toy. Keep it out of
reach of children.
27. Verify that there are no utility lines or
hardware in or near the workpiece. This
is especially critical for plunge cuts.
28. Do not depress the spindle lock when
starting or during operation.
29. People with pacemakers should
consult their physician(s) before use.
Electromagnetic fields in close proximity
to heart pacemaker could cause 
SKU 94245 For technical questions, please call 1-800-444-3353. Page 7

pacemaker interference or pacemaker
failure. In addition, people with
pacemakers should:
• Avoid operating alone.
• Do not use with power switch locked
on.
• Properly maintain and inspect to avoid
electrical shock.
• Any power cord must be properly
grounded. Ground Fault Circuit
Interrupter (GFCI) should also be
implemented – it prevents sustained
electrical shock.
30. WARNING: Some dust created by power
sanding, sawing, grinding, drilling, and
other construction activities, contains
chemicals known [to the State of
California] to cause cancer, birth defects
or other reproductive harm. Some
examples of these chemicals are:
• Lead from lead-based paints
• Crystalline silica from bricks and
cement or other masonry products
• Arsenic and chromium from chemically
treated lumber
Your risk from these exposures varies,
depending on how often you do this type
of work. To reduce your exposure to
these chemicals: work in a well ventilated
area, and work with approved safety
equipment, such as those dust masks
that are specially designed to filter out
microscopic particles. (California Health
& Safety Code § 25249.5, et seq.)
31. WARNING: Handling the cord on this
product will expose you to lead, a
chemical known to the State of California
to cause cancer, and birth defects or
other reproductive harm. Wash hands
after handling. (California Health &
Safety Code § 25249.5, et seq.)
32. The warnings, precautions, and
instructions discussed in this instruction
manual cannot cover all possible
conditions and situations that may occur.
It must be understood by the operator
that common sense and caution are
factors which cannot be built into this
product, but must be supplied by the
operator.
Vibration Safety
This tool vibrates during use. Repeated
or long-term exposure to vibration may cause
temporary or permanent physical injury,
particularly to the hands, arms and shoulders.
To reduce the risk of vibration-related injury:
1. Anyone using vibrating tools regularly
or for an extended period should first
be examined by a doctor and then have
regular medical check-ups to ensure
medical problems are not being caused
or worsened from use. Pregnant
women or people who have impaired
blood circulation to the hand, past hand
injuries, nervous system disorders,
diabetes, or Raynaud’s Disease should
not use this tool. If you feel any medical
or physical symptoms related to vibration
(such as tingling, numbness, and white
or blue fingers), seek medical advice as
soon as possible.
2. Do not smoke during use. Nicotine
reduces the blood supply to the hands
and fingers, increasing the risk of
vibration-related injury.
3. Wear suitable gloves to reduce the
vibration effects on the user.
4. Use tools with the lowest vibration when
there is a choice.
5. Include vibration-free periods each day
of work.
6. Grip tool as lightly as possible (while still
keeping safe control of it). Let the tool
do the work.
SKU 94245 For technical questions, please call 1-800-444-3353. Page 8

7. To reduce vibration, maintain the tool
as explained in this manual. If any
abnormal vibration occurs, stop use
immediately.
Save these
instructions.
Grounding
To prevent
electric shock
and death from incorrect
grounding wire
connection:
Check with a qualified electrician
if you are in doubt as to whether
the outlet is properly grounded.
Do not modify the power cord
plug provided with the tool.
Never remove the grounding
prong from the plug. Do not use
the tool if the power cord or plug
is damaged. If damaged, have it
repaired by a service facility
before use. If the plug will not fit
the outlet, have a proper outlet
installed by a qualified
electrician.
Double Insulated Tools: Tools with
Two Prong Plugs
Outlets for 2-Prong Plug
1. Tools marked “Double Insulated” do not
require grounding. They have a special
double insulation system which satisfies
OSHA requirements and complies with
the applicable standards of Underwriters
Laboratories, Inc., the Canadian
Standard Association, and the National
Electrical Code.
2. Double insulated tools may be used in
either of the 120 volt outlets shown in the
preceding illustration. (See Outlets for
2-Prong Plug.)
Extension Cords
1. Grounded tools require a three wire
extension cord. Double Insulated
tools can use either a two or three wire
extension cord.
2. As the distance from the supply outlet
increases, you must use a heavier gauge
extension cord. Using extension cords
with inadequately sized wire causes a
serious drop in voltage, resulting in loss
of power and possible tool damage.
(See Table A.)
3. The smaller the gauge number of the
wire, the greater the capacity of the cord.
For example, a 14 gauge cord can carry
a higher current than a 16 gauge cord.
(See Table A.)
4. When using more than one extension
cord to make up the total length, make
sure each cord contains at least the
minimum wire size required. (See Table
A.)
5. If you are using one extension cord for
more than one tool, add the nameplate
amperes and use the sum to determine
the required minimum cord size. (See
Table A.)
6. If you are using an extension cord
outdoors, make sure it is marked with the
suffix “W-A” (“W” in Canada) to indicate it
is acceptable for outdoor use.
SKU 94245 For technical questions, please call 1-800-444-3353. Page 9

7. Make sure the extension cord is properly
wired and in good electrical condition.
Always replace a damaged extension
cord or have it repaired by a qualified
electrician before using it.
8. Protect the extension cords from sharp
objects, excessive heat, and damp or
wet areas.
