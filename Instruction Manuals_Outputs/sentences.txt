Pizza\nFor best results when cooking pizza ,use the“ Pizza Mode” :\n· Preheat the oven for at least 10 minutes ;\n· Use a light aluminum pizza pan ,placing it on the grid supplied with the oven .If the dripping pan is used, this\nwill extend the cooking time, making it difficult to get a crispy crust;\n· Do not open the oven door frequently while the pizza is cooking ;\n· If the pizza has a lot of toppings (three of four ),we recommend you add the mozzarella cheese on top halfway\nthrough the cooking process .': 100, '· When cooking pizza on two racks ,use the 2nd and 4th with a temperature
