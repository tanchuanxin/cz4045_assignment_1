How to use your oven
This multi-function oven combines the advantages of traditional convection ovens with those of the more modern
fan assisted models in a single appliance.
It is an extremely versatile appliance that allows you to choose easily and safely between different cooking
modes. The various features offered by the oven are selected by means of selector knob“B”and thermostat“C”
situated on the control panel.
Push-in control knob (only available on certain models)
Control knob can be pushed in, and you can push the control knob lightly to release it or lock it.
Notice: The first time you use your appliance, we recommend that set the thermostat to the highest setting and
leave the oven on for about half an hour with nothing in it, with the oven door shut.Then,open the oven door and
let the room air in. The odor that is often detected during this initial use is due to the evaporation of substances
used to protect the oven during storage and until it is installed.
Notice: Place the dripping pan provided on the bottom shelf of the oven to prevent any sauce and/or grease from
dripping onto the bottom of the oven only when grilling food or when using the rotisserie (only available on certain
models). For all other types of cooking, never use the bottom shelf and never place anything on the bottom of the
oven when it is in operation because this could damage the enamel. Place your cookware (dishes, aluminum foil,
etc. etc.) On the grid provided with the appliance inserted especially along the oven guides.
Notice: to use the oven in manual mode (not using the end cooking time programmer); the symbol must be
aligned with the reference mark on the control panel.
Convection mode 2100-2520W
Position of thermostat knob “C”:between 60℃and Max.on this setting ,The top and bottom heating elements
come on .This is the classic ,traditional type of oven which has been perfected ,with heat distribution and reduced
energy consumption .The convection oven is still unequalled when it comes to cooking dishes made up of
ingredients ,e. g. cabbage with ribs ,Spanish style cod ,Ancona style stockfish ,tender veal strips with
rice ,etc .Excellent results are achieved when preparing veal or beef-based dishes as well (braised
meats ,stew ,goulash, wild game ,ham etc. )which need to cook slowly and basting or the addition of liquid .It
remains the best system for baking cakes as well as fruit and cooking using covered casserole dishes for oven
baking .When cooking in convection mode ,only use one dripping pan or cooking rack at a time ,otherwise the
heat distribution will be uneven .Using the different rack heights available, you can balance the amount of heat
between the top and the bottom of the oven .Select from among the various rack heights based on whether the
dish needs more or less heat from the top .
“Fast cooking”Mode 2125-2560W
Position of thermostat knob “C”:Between 60℃and Max.The top and bottom heating elements, as well as the
fan ,will come on ,guaranteeing constant heat distributed uniformly throughout the oven.
This mode is especially recommended for cooking pre-packed food quickly(as pre-heating is not necessary),such
as for example:frozen or pre-cooked food) as well as for a few “home-made”dishes.
The best results when cooking using the “Fast cooking”mode are obtained if you use one cooking only (the
second from the bottom),please see the table entitled “Practical Cooking Advice”.
Multi-Cooking Mode 2370-2924W
Position of thermostat knob “ C” :Between 60 and Max.The top 、circle and bottom heating elements, as well as
the fan ,will come on alternately .Since the heat remains constant and uniform throughout the oven ,the air cooks
and browns food uniformly over its entire surface. With this mode ,you can also cook various dishes at the same
time ,as long as their respective cooking temperatures are the same .A maximum of 2 racks can be used at the
same time ,following the instructions in the section entitled:“ Cooking On More Than One Rack ” .
This cooking mode is particularly recommended for dishes requiring a gratin finish or for those requiring
considerably prolonged cooking times, such as for example: lasagna, pasta backs, roast chicken and potatoes,
etc..Moreover the excellent heat distribution makes it possible to use lower temperatures when cooking roasts.
This results in less loss of juices, meat which is more tender and a decrease in the loss of weight for the
roast .The Multi-cooking mode is especially suited for cooking fish, which can be prepared with the addition of a
limited amount of condiments, thus maintaining their flavor and appearance.Excellent results can be obtained
when cooking vegetable-based side dishes like courgettes,aubergines,peppers,etc...
Desserts: this mode is also perfect for baking leavened cakes.
This mode can also be used to thaw quickly white or red meat and bread by setting the temperature to 80 .To
thaw more delicate foods ,set the thermostat to 60 or use only the cold air circulation feature by setting the
thermostat to 0 .
Pizza Mode 2772-3420W
Position of thermostat knob“ C” :Between 60 and 250 . The bottom and circle heating elements, as well as the
fan ,will come on.This combination rapidly heats the oven due to the large amounts of power used by the
appliance,which results in the production of considerable heat coming prevalently from the bottom.
The pizza mode is ideal for foods requiring high temperatures to cook,like pizzas and large roasts.Only use one
oven tray or rack at a time.However,if more than one is used,these must be switched halfway through the cooking
process.
Delicate cooking 1220-1460W
Position of thermostat knob“ C” :Between 60 and 250 . The bottom heating element and the fan come on.
Suitable for pastries, cakes and non-dry sweets in baking tins or moulds. Excellent results are also obtained in
cooking requiring above all heat from the bottom.
You are advised to put the pan on a low level.
“ Top” oven 940-1110W
Position of thermostat knob “ C” :Between 60 and Max. The top heating element comes on .This mode can be
used to brown food at the end of cooking .
Grill 2090-2520W
Position of thermostat knob “ C” : Max.The top central heating elements comes on .The extremely high and direct
temperature of the grill makes it possible to brown the surface of meats and roasts while locking the juices in to
keep them tender .The grill is also highly recommended for dishes that require a high temperature on the surface:
beef steaks, veal, rib steak, filets, hamburgers etc …
Cook food with the oven door ajar.
Some grilling examples are included in the “ Practical Cooking Advice ” paragraph .
Fan Assisted Grill 2100-2550W
Position of thermostat knob “ C” :Between 60 and 200 . The top central heating elements and the fan come on.
This combination of features increases the effectiveness of the unidirectional thermal radiation of the heating
elements through forced circulation of the air throughout the oven. This helps prevent food from burning on the
surface, allowing the heat to penetrate right into the food. Excellent results are achieved with kebabs made with
meats and vegetables, sausages, ribs lamb chops, chicken in a spicy sauce, quail, pork chops, etc.
Cook food in “ fan assisted grill mode ” with the oven door shut .
This mode is also ideal for cooking fish steaks, like swordfish, stuffed cuttlefish etc.
Baking Mode 1660-2020W
Position of thermostat knob“ C” :Between 60 and 250 .The rears heating element and the fan come on,
guaranteeing delicate heat distributed uniformly throughout the oven.
This mode is ideal for baking and cooking delicate foods-especially cakes that need to rise,and for the
preparation of certain tartlets on 3 shelves at the same time. Here are a few examples: cream puffs, sweet and
savory biscuits, savoury puffs, Swiss rolls and small portions of vegetables au gratin, etc. „.
“Defrosting”Mode 45-55W
Position of thermostat knob “C ”:Any
The fan located on the bottom of the oven makes the air circulate at room temperature around the food .This is
recommended for the defrosting of all types of food ,but in particular for delicate types of food which do not
require heat ,such as for example :ice cream cakes ,cream or custard desserts ,fruit cakes .By using the fan ,the
defrosting time is approximately halved .In the case of meat ,fish and bread ,it is possible to accelerate the
process using the “Baking”mode and setting the temperature to 80℃-100℃.
The turnspit (only available on certain models)
To start the turnspit, proceed as follows:
· place the oven tray on the 1st rack ;
· insert the special turnspit support on the 2nd rack and position the spit by inserting it through the special hole

How to Keep Your Oven in Shape
Before cleaning your oven, or performing maintenance, disconnect it from the power supply.
To extend the life of your oven, it must be cleaned frequently, keeping in mind that:
· the enameled or stainless steel parts should be washed with lukewarm water without using any abrasive
powders or corrosive substances which could ruin them ;Stainless steel could get stained .If these stains are
difficult to remove, use special products available on the market. After cleaning, it is advisable to rinse thoroughly
and dry.
· the inside of the oven should preferably be cleaned immediately after use ,when it is still warm ,with hot water
and soap ;The soap should be rinsed away and the interior dried thoroughly. Avoid using abrasive detergents (for
example cleaning powders, etc) and abrasive sponges for dishes or acids (such as lime scale –remover, etc„)
as these could damage the enamel .If the grease spots and dirt are particularly tough to remove, use a special
product for oven cleaning, following the instructions provided on the packet. Never use a steam cleaner for
cleaning inside of oven.
· if you use your oven for an extended period of time ,condensation may form .Dry it using a soft cloth.
· there is a rubber seal surrounding the oven opening which guarantees its perfect functioning .Check the
condition of this seal on a regular basis .If necessary, clean it and avoid using abrasive products or objects to do
so. Should it become damaged, please contacts you’re nearest After-sales Service Center .We recommend you
avoid using the oven until it has been repaired.
· never line the oven bottom with aluminum foil ,as the consequent accumulation of heat could compromise the
cooking and even damage the enamel .
· clean the glass door using non-abrasive products or sponges and dry it with a soft cloth .

Practical Cooking Advice
The oven offers a wide range of alternatives which allow you to cook any type of food in the best possible way.
With time you will learn to make the best use of this versatile cooking appliance and the following directions are
only a guideline which may be varied according to your own personal experience.
Preheating
If the oven must be preheated (this is generally the case when cooking leavened foods ),the“Multi-Cooking”
mode and the“Fast cooking”mode can be used to reach the desired temperature as quickly as possible in order
to save on energy .
Once the food has been placed in the oven, the most appropriate cooking mode can then be selected.
Cooking on More Than One Rack
If you have to cook food using several racks, use either the“baking”mode or the“Multi-Cooking”
mode ,as these are the only modes that allow you to do so.
When cooking delicate food on more than one rack, use the“baking”mode, which allows you to cook on 3 racks
at the same time(the 1st 3rd and 5th from the bottom).Some examples are included in the“Practical Cooking
Advice”table.
When cooking other food on several racks, use the“Multi-Cooking”mode keeping the following suggestions in
mind:
· The oven is fitted with 5 racks .During fan assisted cooking, use two of the three central racks; the lowest and
highest racks receive the hot air directly and therefore delicate foodstuffs could be burnt on these racks.
· As a general rule ,use the 2nd and 4th rack from the bottom ,placing the foodstuffs that require greater heat
on the 2nd rack from the bottom .For example, when cooking meat roasts together with other food, place the
roast on the 2nd rack from the bottom and the more delicate food on the 4th rack from the bottom.
· When cooking foodstuffs that require differing times and temperatures ,set a temperature that is somewhere
between the two temperatures required ,place the more delicate food on the 4th rack from the bottom and take
the food requiring less time out of the oven first .
· Use the dripping pan on the lower rack and the grid on the upper ;
Using the“Fast Cooking”Mode
Functional,fast and practical for those of you who use pre-packed products (such as for example:frozen or
pre-cooked food) along with other food items.You will find useful suggestions in the“Practical Cooking Advice”
table.
Using the Grill
This multi-function oven offers you 2 different grilling modes.
Use the “grill ”mode , placing the food under the center of the grill (situated on the
3rd or 4th rack form the bottom )because only the central part of the top heating element is turned on .
Use the bottom rack (1st from the bottom), placing the dripping pan provided to collect any sauce and /or grease
and prevent the same from dripping onto the oven bottom. When using this mode, we recommend you set the
thermostat to the highest setting. However, this does not mean you cannot use lower temperatures, simply by
adjusting the thermostat knob to the desired temperature.
Setting “fan assisted grill ”, is extremely useful for grilling foods rapidly ,as the distribution of heat makes it
possible not only to brown the surface ,but also to cook the bottom part .
Moreover, it can also be used for browning foods at the end of the cooking process, such as adding that gratin
finish to pasta bakes, for example.
When using this mode, place the grid on the 2nd or 3rd oven rack from the bottom (see cooking table ) then ,to
prevent fat and grease from dripping onto the bottom of the oven and thus smoke from forming ,place a
dripping-pan on the 1st rack from the bottom.
When using this mode ,we advise you to set the thermostat to 200℃,as it is the most efficient way to use the
grill ,which is based on the use of infrared rays .However, this does not mean you cannot use lower temperatures,
simply by adjusting the thermostat knob to the desired temperature.
Therefore the best results when using the grill modes are obtained by placing the grid on the lower racks
(see cooking table) then, to prevent fat and grease from dripping onto the bottom of the oven and smoke 
from forming, place a dripping-pan on the 1st oven rack from the bottom.
Baking Cakes
When baking cakes ,always place them in a preheated oven .Make sure you wait until the oven has been
preheated thoroughly (the end light “ E ” will turn off ).Do not open the oven door during baking to prevent the
cake from dropping .In general:
Pastry is too dry
Increase the temperature by 10 and reduce the cooking time .
Pastry dropped
Use less liquid or lower the temperature by 10 .
Pastry is too dark on top
Place it on a lower rack, lower the temperature, and increase the cooking time.
Cooked well on the inside but sticky on the outside
Use less liquid, lower the temperature, and increase the cooking time.
The Pastry sticks to the pan
Grease the pan well and sprinkle it with a dusting of flour or use greaseproof paper.
I used more than one level (in the function “ ventilated oven ” ) and they are not all at the same cooking
point
Use a lower temperature setting .It is not necessary to remove the food from all the racks at the same time.
Cooking Pizza
For best results when cooking pizza ,use the“ Pizza Mode” :
· Preheat the oven for at least 10 minutes ;
· Use a light aluminum pizza pan ,placing it on the grid supplied with the oven .If the dripping pan is used, this
will extend the cooking time, making it difficult to get a crispy crust;
· Do not open the oven door frequently while the pizza is cooking ;
· If the pizza has a lot of toppings (three of four ),we recommend you add the mozzarella cheese on top halfway
through the cooking process .
· When cooking pizza on two racks ,use the 2nd and 4th with a temperature of 220 and place the pizzas in
the oven after having preheated it for at least 10 minutes .
Cooking Fish and Meat
When cooking white meat ,fowl and fish ,use temperature setting from 180 to 200 .
For red meat that should be well done on the outside while tender and juicy in the inside ,it is a good idea to start
with a high temperature setting (200 -220 )for a short time ,then turn the oven down afterwards.
In general, the larger the roast, the lower the temperature setting. Place the meat on the center of the grid and
place the dripping pan beneath it to catch the fat.
Make sure that the grid is inserted so that it is in the center of the oven .If you would like to increase the amount
of heat from below, use the low rack heights .For savory roasts (especially duck and wild game), dress the meat
with lard or bacon on the top.
