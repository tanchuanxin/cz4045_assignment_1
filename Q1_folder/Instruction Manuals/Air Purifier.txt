7 Troubleshooting
This chapter summarizes the most common problems you could encounter with the
appliance. If you are unable to solve the problem with the information below, contact
the Consumer Care Center in your country.
Problem Possible solution
The appliance
does not work
even though it is

The filter replacement code has been displaying on the screen
but you have not replaced the corresponding filter yet. The
appliance will be locked if you keep using the expired filter. In
this case, replace the filter and reset the filter lifetime counter.
The appliance
does not work
even though it is
switched on.
• The appliance is working but the buttons are not
responsive. Check if the child lock is on.
• The filter replacement code has been on
continuously but you have not replaced the
corresponding filter, and the appliance is now
locked. In this case, replace the filter and reset the
filter lifetime counter.
The airflow that
comes out of
the air outlet
