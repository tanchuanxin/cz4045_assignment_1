Before you can begin printing, there are some easy procedures you need to become
familiar with:
● Loading paper (see Loading Paper)
● Inserting print cartridges (see Inserting Print Cartridges)

the In tray.
● Do not load more than 10 sheets of 10 x 30 cm (4 x 12 inches) photo paper for
panoramic printing (possible only when printing from a computer). Loading more
than ten sheets can cause paper feed problems.

the printer
The HP Photosmart 420 series GoGo Photo Studio requires very little maintenance.
Follow the guidelines in this chapter to extend the life span of the printer and printing
supplies, and to ensure that your prints are always of the highest quality.
For information on maintaining the HP Photosmart 420 series camera, see the
Camera User's Manual.
Cleaning and Maintaining the Printer
Keep the printer and print cartridges clean and well maintained using the simple
procedures in this section.
Cleaning the Outside of the Printer
1. Turn off the printer, then disconnect the power cord from the back of the printer.
2. If you installed the optional HP Photosmart Internal Battery in the printer, remove
it, then replace the battery compartment cover.
3. Wipe the outside of the printer with a soft cloth that has been lightly moistened
with water.
Caution 1 Do not use any type of cleaning solution. Household cleaners and
detergents may damage the printer’s finish.
Caution 2 Do not clean the interior of the printer. Keep all fluids away from
the interior.
Cleaning the Print Cartridge
If you notice white lines or single-color streaks on your prints, the print cartridge may
need to be cleaned. Do not clean the cartridge more often than necessary, since
cleaning uses up ink.
1. Make sure the camera is in the camera dock.
2. Press OK to display the menu tabs.
3. Select Clean cartridge, then press OK.
4. Following the directions on the camera Image Display, load paper so the printer
can print a test page after cleaning the cartridge. Use plain paper or index cards
to conserve photo paper.
5. Press OK to begin cleaning the print cartridge.
6. When the printer finishes cleaning the cartridge and prints a test page, check the
test page and select from the following options:
– If the test page has white streaks or missing colors, the print cartridge needs
to be cleaned again. Select Yes on the camera Image Display, then press OK.
– If the print quality of the test page looks good, select Cancel on the camera
Image Display, then press OK.
You can clean the cartridge up to three times. Each successive cleaning is more
thorough and uses more ink.
HP Photosmart 420 series GoGo Photo Studio Printer User's Manual 29
If you complete all three levels of cleaning using this procedure and you still notice
white streaks or missing colors on the test page, you may need to clean the print
cartridge copper-colored contacts. For more information, see Cleaning the Print
Cartridge Contacts.
Note If the cartridge or printer has been recently dropped, you may also see
white streaks or missing colors in your prints. This problem is temporary and
clears up within 24 hours.
Cleaning the Print Cartridge Contacts
If you use the printer in a dusty environment, debris may accumulate on the coppercolored contacts and cause printing problems.
To clean the print cartridge contacts:
1. Gather the following items to clean the contacts:
– Distilled water (tap water may contain contaminants that can damage the
print cartridge)
– Clean, dry lint-free material that will not stick to the print cartridge
2. Open the print cartridge door.
3. Remove the print cartridge and place it on a piece of paper with the ink nozzle
plate facing up. Be careful not to touch the copper-colored contacts or the ink
nozzle plate with your fingers.
Caution Do not leave the print cartridge outside the printer for more than
30 minutes. Ink nozzles exposed to the air longer than this may dry out
and cause printing problems.
4. Lightly moisten a cotton swab with distilled water and squeeze any excess water
from the swab.
5. Gently wipe the copper-colored contacts with the cotton swab.
Caution Do not touch the ink nozzle. Touching the ink nozzle will result
in clogs, ink failure, and bad electrical connections.
6. Repeat steps 4–5 until no ink residue or dust appears on a clean swab.
7. Insert the print cartridge in the printer, then close the print cartridge door.
Printing a Test Page
You can print a test page that contains useful information about the print cartridge,
serial number, and other aspects of the HP Photosmart GoGo Photo Studio.
1. Make sure the camera is in the camera dock.
2. Load paper in the In tray. Use plain paper or index cards to conserve photo paper.
3. Press OK to display the menus.
4. Select Print Test Page, then press OK.

automatically. However, if colors in printouts are misaligned, or if the alignment page
Chapter 4
30 HP Photosmart 420 series GoGo Photo Studio
does not print correctly when you installed a new print cartridge, use the following
procedure to align the print cartridge.
1. Press OK to display the menu tabs.
2. Select Align cartridge, then press OK.
3. A message appears on the camera Image Display reminding you to load plain
paper. Load paper so the printer can print a calibration page. Use plain paper or
index cards to conserve photo paper.
4. Press OK to begin aligning the print cartridge.
When the printer finishes aligning the cartridge, it prints an alignment page to
confirm that the alignment was successful.
– The check marks verify that the print cartridge is installed correctly and
functioning properly.

Storing the HP Photosmart GoGo Photo Studio and Print
Cartridges
Protect the HP Photosmart GoGo Photo Studio and print cartridges by storing them
properly when you are not using them.
Storing the HP Photosmart GoGo Photo Studio
The HP Photosmart GoGo Photo Studio is built to withstand long or short periods of
inactivity.
● Close the In and Output tray doors when the printer is not in use.
● Store the printer indoors out of direct sunlight in a place without temperature
extremes.
● If the printer and print cartridge have not been used for one month or more, clean
the print cartridge before printing. For more information, see Cleaning the Print
Cartridge.
● If you are storing the printer for a long period of time and the optional
HP Photosmart Internal Battery is installed, remove the battery from the printer.
Storing the Print Cartridges
When you store or transport the printer, always leave the active print cartridge inside
the printer. The printer stores the print cartridge in a protective cap during the powerdown cycle.
Chapter 4
32 HP Photosmart 420 series GoGo Photo Studio
Caution Make sure the printer completes its power-down cycle before you
unplug the power cord or remove the internal battery. This allows the printer to
store the print cartridge properly.
Follow these tips to help maintain HP print cartridges and ensure consistent print
quality:
● When you remove a print cartridge from the printer, store it in a print cartridge
protector to prevent the ink from drying out.
In some countries/regions the cartridge protector is not included with the printer,
but comes with the HP Gray Photo cartridge that can be purchased separately. In
other countries/regions, the protector is included with the printer.
● Keep all unused print cartridges in their original sealed packages until they are
needed. Store print cartridges at room temperature (15–35 degrees C or 59–95
degrees F).
● Do not remove the plastic tape covering the ink nozzles until you are ready to
install the print cartridge in the printer. If the plastic tape has been removed from
the print cartridge, do not attempt to reattach it. Reattaching the tape damages
the print cartridge.
Maintaining the Quality of Photo Paper
For best results with photo paper, follow the guidelines in this section.
Storing Photo Paper
● Store the photo paper in its original packaging or in a resealable plastic bag.
● Store the packaged photo paper on a flat, cool, and dry surface.
● Return unused photo paper to the plastic bag. Paper left in the printer or exposed
to the elements may curl.
Handling Photo Paper
● Always hold photo paper by the edges to avoid fingerprints.
● If the photo paper has curled edges, place it in its plastic storage bag and gently
bend it in the opposite direction of the curl until the paper lies flat.

● The memory card may contain file types the printer cannot read directly from
the memory card. This is only an issue when using a PictBridge-certified
camera with the camera port on the front of the printer.
– Save the images to a computer, then print them from the computer. For
more information, see the documentation that came with the camera and
the onscreen HP Photosmart Printer Help.
– The next time you take pictures, set the digital camera to save them in a
file format the printer can read directly from the memory card. For a list
of supported file formats, see Printer Specifications. For instructions on
setting the digital camera to save images in specific file formats, see the
documentation that came with the camera.
● The image filenames have changed from the original filenames assigned to
them by the camera. Make sure the filenames comply with the standard file
naming convention and structure used by the camera.
When the printer is connected to a Macintosh computer, iPhoto and Image
Capture display 0 image files in the camera
Solution Close iPhoto or Image Capture, then press Save on the printer control
panel. An updated count of image files in the camera will appear in the
application that is launched on your computer.
Not all the images on my camera were transferred to my computer when I
pressed Save.
Cause The missing images are stored in the camera's internal memory. Only
images on the camera's memory card are transferred when you press Save on
the printer control panel.
HP Photosmart 420 series GoGo Photo Studio Printer User's Manual 37
Solution Move the images from the camera's internal memory to the camera's
memory card. To do this, press OK to access the menu tabs. Navigate to the
Setup Menu, select Move Images to Card, then press OK.
You can also remove the memory card and then redock the camera. This forces
the HP Photosmart GoGo Photo Studio to read the internal memory of the camera.
The printer is plugged in, but it will not turn on.
Solution
● The printer may have drawn too much power.
If the optional HP Photosmart Internal Battery is not installed in the printer,
unplug the printer power cord. Wait about 10 seconds, then plug the power
cord back in. Turn on the printer.
If the optional HP Photosmart Internal Battery is installed in the printer,
unplug the printer power cord if it is plugged in. Open the battery
compartment cover and remove the battery. Wait about 10 seconds, then
reinstall the battery. If desired, plug in the power cord. Turn on the printer.
● The printer may be plugged into a power strip that is turned off. Turn on the
power strip, then turn on the printer.
● The printer may be plugged into an incompatible power source. If you are
traveling abroad, make certain the power source in the country you are
visiting complies with the power requirements and power cord of the printer.
The optional HP Photosmart Internal Battery is installed in the printer, but the
printer will not turn on using battery power.
Solution
● The battery may need to be charged. Plug in the printer power cord to
charge the battery. The printer battery light flashes green to indicate that the
battery is charging.
● If the optional HP Photosmart Internal Battery is installed in the printer,
unplug the printer power cord if it is plugged in. Open the battery
compartment cover and remove the battery. Wait about 10 seconds, then
reinstall the battery. If desired, plug in the power cord. Turn on the printer.
The optional HP Photosmart Internal Battery is installed in the printer, but it will
not charge.
Solution
● Unplug the printer power cord if it is plugged in. Open the battery
compartment cover and remove the battery. Wait about 10 seconds, then
reinstall the battery. If desired, plug in the power cord. Turn on the printer.
Chapter 5
38 HP Photosmart 420 series GoGo Photo Studio
For more information on how to install the battery, see the documentation
that came with the battery.
● Check that the printer power cord is securely connected to both the printer
and the power source. When the printer is turned off, the printer battery light
on the control panel flashes green to indicate that the battery is charging.
● Turn on the printer. The printer battery light flashes on the control panel to
indicate that the battery is charging.
● An empty battery should fully charge in approximately four hours when the
printer is not in use. If the battery still does not charge, replace it.
The printer makes noises when I turn it on, or starts making noises on its own
after it has been sitting unused for a while.
Solution The printer may make noises after long periods of inactivity
(approximately 2 weeks), or when its power supply has been interrupted and then
restored. This is normal operation—the printer is performing an automatic
maintenance procedure to ensure that it produces the best quality output.
The remote does not work.
Cause
● The battery in the remote may be drained.
● The Output tray is closed.
Solution
● Purchase a new CR2025 battery and replace the old battery with it.
● Open the Output tray. The infrared sensor is on the front of the printer. The
remote cannot communicate with the printer if the Output tray or anything
else covers the sensor.
● Aim directly at the infrared sensor on the front of the printer. Move closer, if
necessary.
● Remove anything that might be covering the sensor or obstructing the line of
sight between it and the remote.
The camera buttons are not working.
Solution You are pushing buttons on the camera after it is placed in the camera
dock. Most camera buttons are disabled when the camera is in the camera dock.
Use the buttons on the control panel instead.
The printer does not recognize the PictBridge camera connected to the camera
port.
Cause The HP Photosmart 420 series GoGo Photo Studio camera was already
in the camera dock when you connected the PictBridge camera to the camera
HP Photosmart 420 series GoGo Photo Studio Printer User's Manual 39
port. The printer only recognizes one camera at a time. Or the PictBridge camera
connected to the camera port was not on.
Solution Disconnect both cameras, then connect the PictBridge camera to the
camera port using the USB cable that came with the camera. If only the
PictBridge camera is connected to the camera port, make sure it is turned on.
Nothing is displayed on the television.
Cause
● Video cable is not connected.
● Television/video input is not selected.
● The HP Photosmart GoGo Photo Studio is not switched to video mode.
Solution
● Make sure the supplied video cable is firmly connected to both the printer
and television.
● Make sure the television is set to receive input from the printer. For more
information, see the user manual that came with the television.
● Press the Video button on the printer control panel or remote control. The
video status light should be on.
The camera batteries will not charge.
Solution
● The supplied camera batteries are not rechargeable. You can buy
rechargeable batteries and replace the supplied batteries with them. For
more information, see the Camera User's Manual.
● The camera is not securely in the camera dock on top of the printer. Make
sure the camera is docked properly.
● Make sure the power cord is connected to the printer and to an active AC
power outlet.
● The HP Photosmart GoGo Photo Studio is running off the optional
HP Photosmart Internal Battery. Rechargeable camera batteries will not
charge unless the printer is connected to an AC power outlet with the power
cord.
Printing Problems
Before contacting HP Customer Care, read this section for troubleshooting tips or go
to the online support services at www.hp.com/support.
Chapter 5
40 HP Photosmart 420 series GoGo Photo Studio
Paper does not feed into the printer correctly.
Solution
● Make sure that the paper-width guide fits close to the edge of the paper
without bending the paper.
● There may be too much paper loaded in the In tray. Remove some paper
and try printing again.
● If sheets of photo paper stick together, try loading one sheet at a time.
● If you are using the printer in an extremely high- or low- humidity
environment, insert the paper as far as it will go into the In tray, and load one
sheet of photo paper at a time.
● If you are using photo paper that is curled, place the paper in a plastic bag
and gently bend it in the opposite direction of the curl until the paper lies flat.
If the problem persists, use paper that is not curled. For information about
proper storage and handling of photo paper, see Maintaining the Quality of
Photo Paper.
● The paper may be too thin or too thick. Try using HP-designed photo paper.
For more information, see Choosing the Best Paper for the Job.
● If you are using 10 x 30 cm (4 x 12 inches) photo paper for panoramic
printing, do not load more than ten sheets in the In tray. Loading more than
10 sheets of this type of paper can cause paper feed problems.
The image printed at an angle or is off-center.
Solution
● The paper may not be loaded correctly. Reload the paper, making sure that
the paper is correctly oriented in the In tray and that the paper-width guide
fits close to the edge of the paper. For paper-loading instructions, see
Loading Paper.
● The print cartridge may need to be aligned. For more information, see
Aligning the Print Cartridge.
No page came out of the printer.
Solution
● The printer may need attention. Read the camera Image Display for
instructions.
● The power may be off or there may be a loose connection. Make sure that
the power is on and the power cord is securely connected. If you are using
battery power, make sure the battery is correctly installed and charged
properly.
HP Photosmart 420 series GoGo Photo Studio Printer User's Manual 41
● You may not have any paper in the In tray. Check that paper is loaded
correctly in the In tray. For paper-loading instructions, see Loading Paper.
● The paper may have jammed while printing. See the following section for
instructions on clearing a paper jam.
The paper jammed while printing.
Solution Check the camera Image Display for instructions. To clear a paper
jam, try the following solutions.
● If the paper came part way through the front of the printer, gently pull the
paper towards you to remove it.
● If the paper did not come part way through the front of the printer, try
removing it from the back of the printer:
– Remove the paper from the In tray, then pull down on the In tray to open
it fully to a horizontal position.
– Gently pull the jammed paper to remove it from the back of the printer.
– Lift the In tray up until it snaps back into paper-loading position.
● If you cannot grasp the edge of the jammed paper to remove it, try the
following:
– Turn off the printer.
– If the optional HP Photosmart Internal Battery is not installed in the
printer, unplug the printer power cord. Wait about 10 seconds, then plug
the power cord back in.
– If the optional HP Photosmart Internal Battery is installed in the printer,
unplug the printer power cord, if it is plugged in. Open the battery
compartment cover and remove the battery. Wait about 10 seconds,
then reinstall the battery. If desired, plug in the power cord.
– Turn on the printer. The printer checks for paper in the paper path and
will automatically eject the jammed paper.
Press OK to continue.
Tip If you experience paper jams while printing, try loading one sheet of
photo paper at a time. Insert the paper as far as it will go into the In tray.
A blank page came out of the printer.
Solution
● Check the ink-level icon on the camera Image Display. If the print cartridge is
out of ink, replace it. For more information, see Inserting Print Cartridges.
● You may have begun printing and then cancelled the process. If you
cancelled the process before the image started printing, the printer may have
already loaded paper in preparation for printing. The next time you print, the
printer will eject the blank page before starting the new printing project.
Chapter 5
42 HP Photosmart 420 series GoGo Photo Studio
The printer ejects the paper when preparing to print.
Solution Direct sunlight could be interfering with the operation of the automatic
paper sensor. Move the printer out of direct sunlight. The printer also ejects paper
if it detects that the paper has already been printed on.
Print quality is poor.
Solution
● The print cartridge may be running out of ink. Check the ink-level icon on the
camera Image Display, and replace the cartridge if necessary. For more
information, see Insert the cartridge:.
● You may have selected a low-resolution setting on the digital camera when
you took the picture. For better results in the future, set the digital camera to
a higher resolution.
● Make sure you are using the right type of photo paper for the project. Use
HP-designed photo paper for best results. For more information, see
Choosing the Best Paper for the Job.
● You may be printing on the wrong side of the paper. Make sure the paper is
loaded with the side to be printed facing toward the front of the printer.
● The print cartridge may need to be cleaned. For more information, see
Cleaning the Print Cartridge.
● The print cartridge may need to be aligned. For more information, see
Aligning the Print Cartridge.
The images I marked for printing in the digital camera do not print.
Solution Some PictBridge-certified digital cameras let you mark images for
printing both in the camera's internal memory and on the memory card (DPOF). If
you mark images in the internal memory, and then move images from the
camera's internal memory to the memory card, the marks may not transfer. Mark
images for printing after you transfer them from a digital camera's internal
memory to the memory card. This is not true of the HP Photosmart GoGo Photo
Studio camera.
Make sure you select Yes when you first dock the camera and are prompted
about printing marked images.
Some commands in the menus are dimmed.
Solution
● You are trying to print a video clip. Video clip printing is not supported. Try
printing another image.
● There are no images on the camera. Take some pictures and then try printing.
● The current image was captured on a different camera and then copied into
the HP Photosmart 420 series GoGo Photo Studio camera internal memory
HP Photosmart 420 series GoGo Photo Studio Printer User's Manual 43
or memory card. The print and red eyes removal options are disabled for
these images.
Bluetooth Printing Problems
Before contacting HP Customer Care, read this section for troubleshooting tips or go
to the online support services at www.hp.com/support. Be sure to also read the
documentation that came with your HP Bluetooth wireless printer adapter and your
device with Bluetooth wireless technology.
My Bluetooth device cannot find the printer.
Solution
● Make sure the HP Bluetooth wireless printer adapter is plugged into the
camera port on the front of the printer. The light on the adapter flashes when
the adapter is ready to receive data.
● You may be too far from the printer. Move the device with Bluetooth wireless
technology closer to the printer. The maximum recommended distance
between the device with Bluetooth wireless technology and the printer is
10 meters (30 feet).
No page came out of the printer.
Solution The printer may not recognize the type of file sent by the device with
Bluetooth wireless technology. For a list of the file formats that the printer
supports, see Printer Specifications.
Print quality is poor.
Solution The image you printed may be low resolution. For better results in the
future, set the device to a higher resolution, if possible. Be aware that pictures
taken with VGA-resolution cameras, such as those found in wireless phones, may
not have high enough resolution to produce a high-quality print.
The image printed with borders.
Solution The printing application installed on your device with Bluetooth
wireless technology may not support borderless printing. Contact the vendor of
the device, or go to their support website to obtain the latest updates for the
printing application.
