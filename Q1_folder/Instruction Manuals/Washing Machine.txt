The amount of detergent you will put in your machine will
depend on the following criteria:
• Your detergent utilization will be based on the degree of
contamination of your laundries. Do not prewash your less
stained laundries and put your slight amount of detergent in
the 2nd compartment of the detergent drawer.
• For your much stained laundries, select a programme in- cluding prewashing, and put ¼ of the detergent you will put in
the detergent drawer in the 1st compartment of the detergent drawer while putting the remaining ¾ of it into 2nd compart- ment.
• Use detergents produced for automatic washing machine in
your machine. The amount of detergent you will use for your laundries is printed on the detergent package.
• The higher the degree of hardness of the water the more
detergent you will use.
• The amount of the detergent you will use will increase as
the amount of your laundries increase.
• Put the softener in the softener compartment in the deter- gent drawer. Do not exceed the MAX level. Otherwise, sof- tener will flow into washing water through flushing.
• Softeners with high density are required to be thinned to a
degree before being put in the drawer. Because high-density softener will clog the flush and avoid the flow of the softener.
• You can use your liquid detergents in all programs without
prewashing. For this, fit liquid detergent level plate in the ac- cessories bag or the liquid detergent apparatus (*) into 2nd compartment of the detergent drawer and set the
amount of liquid detergent according to the levels on this
plate. Remember to detach the liquid detergent plate.
