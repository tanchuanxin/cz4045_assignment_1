repaired.': 23, '· never line the oven bottom with aluminum foil ,as the consequent accumulation of heat could compromise the\ncooking and even damage the enamel .': 25, '· clean the glass door using non-abrasive products or sponges and dry it with a soft cloth .': 18, 'How to Remove the Oven door\nFor a more thorough clean, you can remove the oven door.': 17, 'Choose the remove and assemble method\nAccording to different structure of oven door purchased.': 14, 'Proceed as follows:\nOven door structures 1 remove and assemble procedure:\n· Open the door fully ;\n· Lift up and turn the

'Practical Cooking Advice\nThe oven offers a wide range of alternatives which allow you to cook any type of food in the best possible way.': 25, 'With time you will learn to make the best use of this versatile cooking appliance and the following directions are\nonly a guideline which may be varied according to your own personal experience.': 33, 'Preheating\nIf the oven must be preheated (this is generally the case when cooking leavened foods ),the“Multi-Cooking”\nmode and the“Fast cooking”mode can be used to reach the desired temperature as quickly as possible in order\nto save on energy .': 40, 'Once the food has been placed in the oven, the most appropriate cooking mode can then be selected.': 18, 'Cooking on More Than One Rack\nIf you have to cook food using several racks, use either the“baking”mode or the“Multi-Cooking”\nmode ,as these are the only modes that allow you to do so.': 33, 'When cooking delicate food on more than one rack, use the“baking”mode, which allows you to cook on 3 racks\nat the same time(the 1st 3rd and 5th from the bottom).Some examples are included in the“Practical Cooking\nAdvice”table.': 37, 'When cooking other food on several racks, use the“Multi-Cooking”mode keeping the following suggestions in\nmind:\n· The oven is fitted with 5 racks .During fan assisted cooking, use two of the three central racks; the lowest and\nhighest racks receive the hot air directly and therefore delicate foodstuffs could be burnt on these racks.': 54, '· As a general rule ,use the 2nd and 4th rack from the bottom ,placing the foodstuffs that require greater heat\non the 2nd rack from the bottom .For example, when cooking meat roasts together with other food, place the\nroast on the 2nd rack from the bottom and the more delicate food on the 4th rack from the bottom.': 60, '· When cooking foodstuffs that require differing times and temperatures ,set a temperature that is somewhere\nbetween the two temperatures required ,place the more delicate food on the 4th rack from the bottom and take\nthe food requiring less time out of the oven first .': 46, '· Use the dripping pan on the lower rack and the grid on the upper ;\nUsing the“Fast Cooking”Mode\nFunctional,fast and practical for those of you who use pre-packed products (such as for example:frozen or\npre-cooked food) along with other food items.You will find useful suggestions in the“Practical Cooking Advice”\ntable.': 51, 'Using the Grill\nThis multi-function oven offers you 2 different grilling modes.': 12, 'Use the “grill ”mode , placing the food under the center of the grill (situated on the\n3rd or 4th rack form the bottom )because only the central part of the top heating element is turned on .': 38, 'Use the bottom rack (1st from the bottom), placing the dripping pan provided to collect any sauce and /or grease\nand prevent the same from dripping onto the oven bottom.': 30, 'When using this mode, we recommend you set the\nthermostat to the highest setting.': 14, 'However, this does not mean you cannot use lower temperatures, simply by\nadjusting the thermostat knob to the desired temperature.': 20, 'Setting “fan assisted grill ”, is extremely useful for grilling foods rapidly ,as the distribution of heat makes it\npossible not only to brown the surface ,but also to cook the bottom part .': 34, 'Moreover, it can also be used for browning foods at the end of the cooking process, such as adding that gratin\nfinish to pasta bakes, for example.': 27, 'When using this mode, place the grid on the 2nd or 3rd oven rack from the bottom (see cooking table ) then ,to\nprevent fat and grease from dripping onto the bottom of the oven and thus smoke from forming ,place a\ndripping-pan on the 1st rack from the bottom.': 50, 'When using this mode ,we advise you to set the thermostat to 200℃,as it is the most efficient way to use the\ngrill ,which is based on the use of infrared rays .However, this does not mean you cannot use lower temperatures,\nsimply by adjusting the thermostat knob to the desired temperature.': 52, 'Therefore the best results when using the grill modes are obtained by placing the grid on the lower racks\n(see cooking table) then, to prevent fat and grease from dripping onto the bottom of the oven and smoke \nfrom forming, place a dripping-pan on the 1st oven rack from the bottom.': 51, 'Baking Cakes\nWhen baking cakes ,always place them in a preheated oven .Make sure you wait until the oven has been\npreheated thoroughly (the end light “ E ” will turn off ).Do not open the oven door during baking to prevent the\ncake from dropping .In general:\nPastry is too dry\nIncrease the temperature by 10 and reduce the cooking time .': 63, 'Pastry dropped\nUse less liquid or lower the temperature by 10 .': 12, 'Pastry is too dark on top\nPlace it on a lower rack, lower the temperature, and increase the cooking time.': 20, 'Cooked well on the inside but sticky on the outside\nUse less liquid, lower the temperature, and increase the cooking time.': 21, 'The Pastry sticks to the pan\nGrease the pan well and sprinkle it with a dusting of flour or use greaseproof paper.': 22, 'I used more than one level (in the function “ ventilated oven ” ) and they are not all at the same cooking\npoint\nUse a lower temperature setting .It is not necessary to remove the food from all the racks at the same time.': 45, 'Cooking Pizza\nFor best results when cooking pizza ,use the“ Pizza Mode” :\n· Preheat the oven for at least 10 minutes ;\n· Use a light aluminum pizza pan ,placing it on the grid supplied with the oven .If the dripping pan is used, this\nwill extend the cooking time, making it difficult to get a crispy crust;\n· Do not open the oven door frequently while the pizza is cooking ;\n· If the pizza has a lot of toppings (three of four ),we recommend you add the mozzarella cheese on top halfway\nthrough the cooking process .': 100, '· When cooking pizza on two racks ,use the 2nd and 4th with a temperature of 220 and place the pizzas in\nthe oven after having preheated it for at least 10 minutes .': 34, 'Cooking Fish and Meat\nWhen cooking white meat ,fowl and fish ,use temperature setting from 180 to 200 .': 19, 'For red meat that should be well done on the outside while tender and juicy in the inside ,it is a good idea to start\nwith a high temperature setting (200 -220 )for a short time ,then turn the oven down afterwards.': 42, 'In general, the larger the roast, the lower the temperature setting.': 11, 'Place the meat on the center of the grid and\nplace the dripping pan beneath it to catch the fat.': 20, 'Make sure that the grid is inserted so that it is in the center of the oven .If you would like to increase the amount\nof heat from below, use the low rack heights .For savory roasts (especially duck and wild game), dress the meat\nwith lard or bacon on the top.': 52, 'Selector knob\nsetting\nFood to be cooked Weight\n(in kg )\nCooking rack\nposition
