Being an apple fan, I love these! They are so easy to connect! Once I connected them to my iPhone, they were seamlessly connected to my other apple devices. All I have to do is select them in the list from the device you need them to connect and you are good to go. Another good thing is turning them on/off is easy, just remove them from the charging case and they turn on and put them back to turn them off, its simple. And like most of the earphones out there, they connect to the last device you used them with, but its easy to switch device. You have the flexibility to just use one piece, if you like and sometimes it does come handy. Another function I like is the automatic ear detection, just remove a piece from you ear and playback will pause and resume once you put it back, this does help when someone drops by for a conversation and you don't need to actually pickup your phone to pause the playback. The battery life is definitely impressive, I need to charge the case every 2 days. And it's easy to carry everywhere, it being so small. Now the sound quality is crisp and connection is smooth, I found that the 2nd gen AirPods are actually better and improved on 1st gen, but its not worth to upgrade, but if you are planning to get your first one, I would definitely say go for the 2nd gen AirPods, I got a pretty sweet deal on amazon and am very happy with my purchase.","pair of earphones, battery life, sound quality, connectino, deal","best, definitely impressive, crisp, smooth, pretty sweet",positive,

I was getting tired of ones that attached and had the cord that went around my neck. Hence, I decided to search the internet for the best headphones that would work for listening to music/audio books while working out or doing things around the house. I finally decided to try out the AirPods since they had such great reviews, and because they were on sale. When I received the AirPods, I was surprised at how well they actually fit in my ears. I had worried about them falling out, and though they have fallen out a few times due to my children rough housing and landing on my head, they have worked great for walking around the house and exercising. The sound quality is really amazing, and I am pleasantly surprised at how quickly they charge. I will update this once I've had them longer than a few weeks, but I am extremely impressed with them so far. I was extremely skeptical at first, but I'm very glad I decided to get them!","headphones, reviews, sound quality","best, great, really amazing",positive,

Great for walking due to Siri based controls. Siri also let’s me look unfamiliar words while listening to audiobooks, which I love. Only earbuds I’ve ever found that stay in my ears, yet so light and comfortable that I forget I have them in. Not exactly a fashion statement in my opinion. I joke that, with the white protuberances going down out of the years of an older guy, it looks like his hearing aids are melting.

Everyone who's going to buy AirPods already knows that they like them or not. Apple is releasing some AirPods with noise cancellation, I think that's the biggest complaint most people have: that they don't feel like they're deafened to the world around them. But everytime someone comes into my office I have to stop the music or take the AirPods completely out of my ears to hear them clearly. The sound quality is decent. I'm no audiophile so to me they sound great. They also are easy to lose, but so are any other tiny cordless in-ear earphones. Just keep track of them and you should be good to go. At first they hurt my ears so I bought some silicone covers with wingtips. They helped the AirPods stay in my ears without moving around and ""softened"" the edges of the earphones. I guess they stretched my ears out or I just got used to wearing them, because now even without the silicone covers they fit and feel just fine. The battery life is pretty good, and popping them back in the case for 10-15 minutes boosts them almost back up to full. So I'll wear them at work and then if I get up to grab a drink or use the bathroom I'll give the AirPods a quick charge and be good to go the rest of the day. At first double-tapping to get them to pause or skip a song was frustrating but there's a tutorial online somewhere that shows you where to tap to get consistent results: just above the neck of the AirPods. They pair immediately with your iPhone and I've never had any connectivity issues or sound quality issues, so I'm very happy with my purchase.","sound quality, battery life","decent, pretty good",positive,

Out of the box and after fully charging, I was amazed at how fast they paired with my iPhone7. I have about 20 sets of earphones, ranging in price from the cheapo Monoprice to the Bose Sportsound. So, I put them in my ear canals and headed out for my 3-mile loop. I had expressed doubt that they would remain seated in my external auditory meatus while running. I had not gone 100m and the left one popped out and hit the pavement. This happened three more times before I was done. The right channel never moved. The sound quality was excellent. Not so great for excluding the ambient sound of passing cars. So, bottom line: great packaging. Long play life. Excellent sound in environments where ambient noise is around 80dB. If your ears are like mine, you’ll likely be picking one of them off the ground. The touch feature is great for taking phone calls. But, the Bose wins hands down for fit and exclusion of background noise. Plus, you have a fail-safe wire connecting both buds, a comforting thought when riding a bike.

They are essentially useless now. I would recommend purchasing through Apple so you can get another pair if yours malfunctions. Since I purchased on here and the return window is closed, I cannot get another pair, which means $130 down the drain. This was definitely one of my best Amazon purchases. The sound quality on these is amazing even during phone calls. The charging case holds an impressive amount of charge so I only need to recharge it once every 2-3 days, which isn't very much considering I use these 8-10 hours a day.at work. That being said, there are some cons to these. The battery life of the AirPods themselves isn't the best-- you'll get 1-2 hours max. Now, five minutes in the charging case will get these back to full charge, so take that with a grain of salt. The biggest con for me has been the Bluetooth connectivity. I have an IPhone 11 so I would expect these to have no issues with connecting. However, every few times I use these, one or both of the AirPods does not connect when I pull it out of the case. It usually takes about five minutes to figure out the problem and re-connect them. It's definitely a problem when I'm trying to pick up a call on my AirPods or listen to something quickly. For that reason, I'd give these 4/5 stars. They're still worth the purchase but I'd recommend adding AppleCare so you can get a replacement if you have the same issues. (P.S. If you have an Apple watch, these do not connect independently to the Apple Watch, you will need to have your IPhone on you.)","sound quality, battery life, purchase","amazing, isn't the best, worth",negative,Can the model capture updates?

 2. Faster connection speed. After adding the H1 chip,there is a big increase in connection speed when pairing devices. When pairing and devices switching, airpods 2 will respond twice as fast as the old model. It is easy to feel that.

 I regularly use my air pods on both iOS and Android devices. The air pods connect relatively quickly and easily to both, but especially with other Apple devices. (For some reason, the max volume is significantly lower on my Android device.) The Bluetooth range is not great with reception starting to break up if you move more than 4-5' away from the phone. The sound is pretty clear, but less than 10 weeks after purchase, individual ear buds will cut in and out or get static-y even while sitting stationary next to my phone. Like other reviewers, my individual ear buds don't seem to charge evenly with one often dying well before the second. I've also been disappointed with the battery performance. The ear buds re-charge quickly when inserted into the case and I'd say I can probably get 5 hours of run time between charges of the *case*, but I struggle to regularly get more than 2 hours of run time per full charge of the ear buds (and oftentimes not even that). Finally, I have no idea how people wear these all the time as I found the shape of the air pods to be tremendously uncomfortable. (Though I am aware accessories exist to mitigate this issue)

https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IGVOZS435CIL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07PXGQC1Q,4,"These air pods have surprisingly good battery life and are really comfortable to wear. I primarily use my air pods during work. So probably 5-8 hours a work day. I use them intermittently due to having to interact with my coworkers. I charge them every time I have to give someone my attention. As a result of that I've never ran out of battery life in a single day. I also find them extremely comfortable, like I forget they are even there sometimes if I paused my audiobook. While I don't exercise with them, I haven't had one fall out yet during regular use. But I am cautious enough to not use them around water as I fear they might fall out and be damaged in such circumstances.
 
 Unfortunately, we are only allowed one earbud in while we work. Some areas of my workspace are loud due primarily to large AC units and conveyors converging in certain areas. Due to this, I do have one complaint about them. They don't cancel noise very well. I used to have another pair of wireless ear buds and they were much better at cancelling out sound, even with one ear free. As a result I am frequently having to pause my audiobook in these areas as I don't want to blow out one of my eardrums trying to overpower the external sounds with raising the volume of my device.
 
 As to regards about sound quality, I find them good for my purposes. Listening to podcasts and audiobooks in standard quality. I have decent headphones at home if I want an audiophile experience with high quality audio formats especially with music, games, and shows. But the air pods don't necessarily sound terrible. They are just a little annoying to pair between my iphone and pc back and forth. (Not a fan of Macs, sorry apple crowd)
 
 As I only use them while I work, I don't take calls, so I can't comment on the sound receiving end of the earbuds and their use as a headset.
